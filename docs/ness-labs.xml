<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>In a world that often feels like it&#8217;s moving at breakneck speed, it’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of everyday stress and distractions, and forget about the simple pleasures that can brighten our days. But the key to happiness lies in the small, seemingly insignificant moments that make up our lives.</p>



<p>From the sound of your favorite feel-good playlist to the satisfying sip of your favorite tea, these little moments of joy have the power to instantly transform your mood. By understanding the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/psychology-of-happiness">chemistry of happiness</a> in your brain and identifying your personal “joy triggers,” you can unlock a constant source of positivity that’s always within reach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The brain chemicals of joy and happiness</h2>



<p>There are four main neurochemicals that are fundamentally linked to pleasure and well-being. Together, they are responsible for creating the emotions and sensations we have come to associate with joy and happiness.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dopamine.</strong> This neurotransmitter plays a major role in motivation and the anticipation of reward. When you achieve a goal, accomplish a task, or hit a target, you receive a pleasurable hit of dopamine. It’s basically your brain telling you that you’ve done a good job. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, eating, and playing video games—increase dopamine release and therefore make you want to repeat them.</li>



<li><strong>Serotonin.</strong> While serotonin has a complex biological function, it’s popularly known as the molecule of happiness. A variety of antidepressants called Serotonin-Specific Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) work by interfering with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it&#8217;s done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting serotonin levels in the synapses. They don’t work for everyone but show the important role of serotonin when it comes to happiness.</li>



<li><strong>Oxytocin.</strong> Often called the molecule of bonding, it’s associated with close relationships, skin-to-skin contact, affection, and loving touch. This is what makes you feel good when you receive a hug or play with a pet. Oxytocin is also produced in abundance during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</li>



<li><strong>Endorphins.</strong> Short for “endogenous morphine”—which means self-produced morphine—they are produced by the central nervous system to help us deal with physical pain. Even though endorphin molecules seem to be too large to pass freely across the blood-brain barrier, some researchers think they are associated with the runner’s high—the feeling of euphoria people get when exercising.</li>
</ul>



<p>Another molecule that was discovered relatively more recently are endocannabinoids, basically self-produced cannabis. Research <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442371">found</a> that both humans and dogs show significantly increased endocannabinoids following sustained running, so they’re also a potential candidate for the runner’s high phenomenon.</p>



<p>The great news is that there are many activities that can increase the levels of “happiness neurotransmitters” in your brain. While some activities have been extensively studied – such as sex and exercise – many can be personal to you, for example if they activate the reward system and release dopamine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Define your joy triggers</h2>



<p>In a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4ZyHn9A3E"> talk</a> she gave a few years ago, Arianna Huffington, the founder of The Huffington Post and Thrive Global, described what she called “joy triggers”—simple ways to feel instantly happier. The expression defines exactly what it is: a way to trigger a feeling of joy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It’s not enough to be productive. It’s not enough to be successful. I need my joy triggers. Joy triggers are not rational. Bring them into your daily life, because I really believe that it’s all a part of how we can bring balance into our life—getting joy from simple but beautiful things.”</p>
<cite>Arianna Huffington, Founder &amp; CEO, Thrive Global.</cite></blockquote>



<p>There are two ways to define your joy triggers: retroactively or in the moment. The first one consists in sitting down, remembering all the times you felt happy, comfortable, relaxed, joyful, or positively excited, and writing them down. It’s an interesting exercise but research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614542274">suggests</a> that we tend to not remember ordinary, mundane experiences very well – the small things get forgotten easily.</p>



<p>This is why the second approach can be more effective. It consists in being more aware and mindful of these joyful moments when they happen, and writing them down as you go. Here’s how to do this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="The Joy Triggers Cycle" class="wp-image-15205" height="577" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/joy-triggers-image-1024x577.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Collect joy triggers.</strong> Create a dedicated note called “joy triggers” on your phone, and add to it every time you feel good. You will end up with a list of small sources of joy in your life.</li>



<li><strong>Keep your list accessible.</strong> Ideally, your joy triggers should be simple activities that you could easily repeat any time you need to quickly improve your mood. For example, drinking a cup of nice tea, listening to a specific song, looking at a picture of your children when they were babies, going for a quick run, re-reading one of your favorite poems, petting your dog.</li>



<li><strong>Use your joy triggers to boost your mood.</strong> Every time you feel down, stressed, or anxious, and need a shot of joy, open the list and pick something that you can do right now. Stop everything else you are doing and focus on that one simple activity. Be present and mindful. This will of course not get rid of all of your problems, but this small moment of joy may be just what you need to manage to get through the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>Incorporating small moments of joy into your daily life can have a profound impact on your overall well-being. By taking the time to identify your joy triggers and making a conscious effort to experience them regularly, you can create a powerful tool for managing stress, boosting your mood, and finding happiness in the present moment.</p>



<p>The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and accessibility. No matter what challenges you face or how busy your schedule may be, there’s always an opportunity to pause and savor life’s little pleasures. Whether it’s the first sip of your morning coffee, the sound of your favorite song, or the feeling of the sun on your face, these tiny moments of joy serve as a reminder that happiness is not some far-off goal, but rather something that can be cultivated and experienced every day.</p>



<p>So, start building your own collection of joy triggers, and make a habit of turning to them whenever you need a quick pick-me-up. And consider sharing these little moments with others – by doing so, you’ll not only enhance your own well-being but also inspire those around you to find more joy in their daily lives.</p>

<title>Manage your Mood with Oleksandr Zhabin, founder of Moodset</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<a class="featured-tool-label" href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">FEATURED TOOL</a>



<p>Welcome to this edition of our Tools for Thought series. Oleksandr Zhabin is the founder of  Moodset, an app that allows you to track, explore, and understand your mood through music. It’s based on the circumplex model of affect and lets you place a dot on the mood map to mark where you are on the emotional spectrum based on valence and arousal values.</p>



<p>In this interview, we talked about the limitations with most mood tracking apps, the relationship between mood and music, implementing a useful in-app model of emotions, the ideal frequency for mood tracking, how to use playlists to manage your mood, and much more. Enjoy the read!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Moodset Image 1" class="wp-image-15193" height="540" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moodset-image-4.jpg" width="960" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Hi Oleksandr, thanks for agreeing to this interview! How did you start exploring the intersection of mood and music?</strong></p>



<p>My journey of exploring the intersection of mood and music began with a challenge I faced in 2022. It was a tough year that completely changed my life. War broke out in my country, and global economic issues were beginning to unfold. Due to these events, I lost my job, and finding a new one didn’t seem promising. It’s hard to convey what was going on in my mind at that time and what emotions I was experiencing.</p>



<p>However, I was very curious to understand how my state of mind changed from the onset of the war and how different it was from ordinary days before all these events. After all, mental state has a huge impact on the decisions we make and on life in general.</p>



<p>Although I’ve always been interested in self-exploration, I never thought about mood tracking. That’s why I didn’t have any data to analyze how my mood had changed over the past few years. And then I asked myself, are there any indicators that could reflect our mood? After some googling and reading many studies, I realized that music is a good indicator. Moreover, music not only reflects the listener’s mood, but it also influences their mood.</p>



<p><strong>So that’s why you started building Moodset.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, this is how the story of creating Moodset begins. I started searching for websites or apps that would allow me to track the mood of the music I was listening to. But I didn’t find anything. The best thing I came across was the ability to assess the mood of a playlist, which obviously didn’t meet my needs.</p>



<p>Given the difficulties in finding a new job and the high chance of being laid off again even if I found one, I decided that it was a perfect opportunity to do something I’d long dreamed of &#8211; creating my own product.</p>



<p>At that time, I was thinking like an engineer and making not the best decisions from a business perspective. For example, I planned three features for the first version of the app instead of focusing on one core feature and getting feedback on it as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Also, instead of developing the app on Flutter for both iOS and Android from the start, I chose to create a native app only for Android. Considering that I’m a solo maker, creating native apps for each platform is an unaffordable luxury.</p>



<p>As a result, the first version was released with two features: automatic mood tracking of the music being listened to and creating a playlist with selected moods and genres. Spotify was used as the data source for music, and it remains the only data source to this day. However, I plan to expand the list of platforms that Moodset integrates with in the future.</p>



<p>Today, the app already has a few more features than the first version. It now includes the ability to manually record your mood, set reminders to record your mood, and synchronize data between your devices. And this is just the beginning.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Moodset Image 2" class="wp-image-15194" height="540" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moodset-image-1.jpg" width="960" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Moodset is built around the concept of a “circumplex model of affect” – can you tell us more?</strong></p>



<p>When I was exploring the Spotify API, I didn’t fully understand all the data they provided about music tracks. I started delving into the topic and realized that this data fits perfectly with the circumplex model of affect. In this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367156">research</a>, you can learn more about it in detail and understand how it surpasses the basic theory of emotions.</p>



<p>In brief, the circumplex model of affect posits that emotions are not discrete but rather points in a two-dimensional space. One of these dimensions is valence, which ranges from negative to positive emotions. The other is arousal, which ranges from low arousal (boredom, calm) to high arousal (anxious, excited).</p>



<p>In many mood trackers, I often see that the graphs use only one dimension, which can be defined as valence from the circumplex model of affect. But it gives people a limited understanding of their mood. For example, looking at a graph, it becomes impossible to distinguish between sadness and anger—both would just be considered a bad mood. It’s also impossible to get an idea of the intensity of the experiences.</p>



<p>However, Moodset addresses this problem by using two dimensions, giving users a more comprehensive understanding of their mood when looking at the graph.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Moodset Image 3" class="wp-image-15195" height="540" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moodset-image-2.jpg" width="960" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>How exactly can users track their mood with Moodset?</strong></p>



<p>After reading a substantial number of studies on the circumplex model of affect, I developed a graph that I call the mood map. This graph is a square divided into zones, each named after a mood that represents just one of the many moods contained within that zone. These zone names are intended merely to provide a general understanding of the mood map’s layout.</p>



<p>For example, in the Tense zone, points on opposite borders of the zone represent two entirely different moods, and neither might be accurately described as Tense. Therefore, I encourage users to focus more on the percentage values of valence and arousal. However, if you wish to verbalize your mood, the app allows for that.</p>



<p>Here’s how a user can record their mood: a person places a point on the mood map according to their feelings. If they wish, they can name this mood. They can also select tags for this entry, representing factors that influenced their emotional state. Tags can be created, edited, and deleted. They help speed up the mood recording process if you’re not in the mood to write but still want context. Additionally, users can write a note describing their experience in detail if they choose.</p>



<p>The app can also automatically track the music you listen to, providing the mood for each track played. This feature includes data such as top tracks, artists, and genres for a selected day or month.</p>



<p>All this information can be viewed on graphs with varying levels of detail, selecting appropriate scopes. For example, the Day scope will show the mood for each entry or each track listened to on the selected day. The Year scope will show average mood values for entries and music during each month, along with other aggregated data.</p>



<p>Moods by days or months can be conveniently viewed on a timeline, displaying valence and arousal values as two separate lines. By clicking on a specific timestamp, a point will appear on the mood map showing where you were on the emotional spectrum.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Moodset Image 4" class="wp-image-15196" height="540" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/moodset-image-3.jpg" width="960" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>The visual mood map sounds amazing. How can it be used to effectively manage your mood?</strong></p>



<p>Keeping a mood journal can be beneficial even if you never intend to revisit what you’ve written. Numerous studies, including this <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00403.x">one</a>, suggest that when people write about their emotional experiences, it significantly improves their mental and physical health. If you also analyze your past entries and compare them with changes in your mood, you can understand the long-term effects of various experiences. You can identify recurring experiences that significantly impact your mental state. In fact, analysis can reveal a lot.</p>



<p>Regarding the mood of the music you listen to, this provides additional context. For instance, you might mark your average mood for the day as relaxed in the evening, not remembering that you were quite energized and dancing to your favorite tracks in the middle of the day. In such cases, the musical data will remind you of that.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you didn’t make any entries yesterday but see that you listened to angry death metal, you might conclude that things probably weren’t going well for you. It’s important to note that for some people, listening to angry death metal is a daily norm and doesn’t necessarily mean they were angry. This person will have their own patterns in music listening and its connections to their mood. Observation and identification of patterns relevant to you are required.</p>



<p>Tracking musical mood can also reveal that sad music dominates your playlist. This might not only reflect your mood but also influence it. Try experimenting by listening to more positive and energetic music for several days. This might improve your mood. The app can help with this, too. Select your desired mood, your favorite genre, and create a playlist.</p>



<p><strong>How often do you think people should track their mood?</strong></p>



<p>I track my mood every day. However, the optimal frequency depends on an individual’s needs and preferences. Daily mood tracking offers a detailed and comprehensive picture of a person’s emotional fluctuations. It can help quickly identify patterns and triggers related to specific events, activities, or times of the day.</p>



<p>However, for some, daily tracking may be too burdensome. In such cases, trying weekly mood tracking might be more suitable. This approach provides a broader perspective, making it easier to identify long-term trends without the need for daily entries.</p>



<p>In any case, consistency is key. Choose an approach that allows you to record your mood without abandoning the practice.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of people use Moodset?</strong></p>



<p>First and foremost, these are people who care about their mental health. Those who want to live a full life enriched with the entire spectrum of emotions, and naturally, who want most of these emotions to be positive.</p>



<p>Often, people start looking for solutions when they encounter problems, and so, people may come to Moodset when they are experiencing unpleasant feelings. These could be students, knowledge workers, or anyone deeply immersed in their work or business.</p>



<p>For example, when a person is overloaded or things are not going well and they don’t pay enough attention to their inner world, stress accumulates and burnout occurs. This could have been prevented by reflecting while recording their experiences, or by identifying long-term shifts in mood by analyzing graphs. And if one cannot address these issues on their own, they can seek help from a specialist.</p>



<p>I believe that many people do not take mental health seriously and do not realize that such an app could be useful for them. It not only helps prevent burnout and similar issues (which is already significant), but it can also help increase productivity, for instance. Productivity is heavily influenced by our mood. Therefore, the potential range of users is quite broad, though not all of them know this yet.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, how do you use Moodset?</strong></p>



<p>I use Moodset every day. As I tell you this, I have a streak of 185 consecutive days of logging my mood. I set up three reminders for mood entries: at 11am, 5pm, and 11pm. At each reminder, I summarize that part of the day. I reflect on how I feel at the moment, what emotions I experienced during that part of the day, and mark a point on the mood map that represents the average of all my states.</p>



<p>Then, I consider all the factors that influenced my mood and mark them with pre-created tags. If there were any extreme experiences or if some thoughts are bothering me, I add a note. On days when I don’t add notes, the whole process takes less than a minute. In total, I spend 3 minutes a day and get three entries about how I felt in the morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>



<p>This allows me to later analyze these data on graphs with different scopes. Additionally, I gain increased self-awareness every day. When I first started this practice, I was surprised to realize that without logging my mood, I didn’t even know what state I was in throughout the day. And I’m not even talking about reflecting on what influences my state. Usually, I only knew about my state when experiencing extreme emotions. Now, things are different.</p>



<p>From time to time, I review how my mood changes throughout the month. The Month scope helps me with this. On the graph, I quickly find days when I was more aroused than usual or when my mood was too negative. Then, I select that day and go into the details to find out what caused it. By quickly reviewing the days that stand out from the general trend, I identify negative influences and try to eliminate these factors in the future.</p>



<p>The Year scope also offers an interesting perspective, allowing me to see how my average mood changes month by month. It’s interesting to observe seasonal deviations or when a particular problem arises and remains unresolved for a long time.</p>



<p>The same is true for music. I review the mood of the music I listen to across different scopes. Sometimes, there are obvious correlations with my mood entries. Top tracks, artists, and genres add context for analysis.</p>



<p>Sometimes, I find myself in a mood that I want to enhance with music, and I don’t have a special playlist for that. Then, I use the corresponding function in the app to quickly create a playlist with that mood.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for Moodset?</strong></p>



<p>The plans for Moodset are ambitious. It’s a lot for one person to handle, so I hope to start expanding the team at some moment.</p>



<p>Let’s start with what I would like to accomplish in the near future. I definitely want to release Moodset for iOS. I also want to integrate with more streaming platforms. Regarding music, the accuracy of determining the mood of tracks will be improved (as it is not 100% accurate at the moment).</p>



<p>There is also the idea to add analysis of the lyrics of the music being listened to, as they carry messages that influence our thoughts. I am currently studying the necessity and feasibility of implementing this.</p>



<p>Looking at it more broadly, I plan to add more sources of mood and factors that influence mood, automating their collection wherever possible. Data analysis will also be enhanced, as it’s difficult to keep track of everything when there’s a lot of data. Moodset should become a platform that helps people live healthy and happy lives.</p>

<title>The Shiny Toy Syndrome: When We Chase Novelty at Work</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/shiny-toy-syndrome?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=shiny-toy-syndrome</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/shiny-toy-syndrome?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=shiny-toy-syndrome</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You’re at your desk, ready to write an article. A quick mind map might help organize your thoughts, so you start scribbling in your notebook. But then, a nagging thought arises: isn’t there a better tool out there? Before you know it, you’re searching for alternatives and watching tutorials. Hours slip by, and your article is still just an idea.</p>



<p>The shiny toy syndrome is characterized by getting an intense but temporary sense of satisfaction from using a new tool before moving onto something else. This desire to use the latest and supposedly greatest is often irrespective of the practical need for it.</p>



<p>This applies equally to tangible and intangible toys: many entrepreneurs suffer from this constant need to build something new, and developers often try new languages just because they’re more recent and therefore more exciting.</p>



<p>In fact, once you start looking, you’ll notice the shiny toy syndrome is everywhere. New technologies are being adopted everyday just because they’re perceived as innovative. Freelancers have to battle random requests from clients who want to include buzzworthy features. Companies invest in new training without considering first whether they are fit for purpose.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of the shiny toy syndrome</h2>



<p>It’s natural to be attracted to new things. It’s actually hardwired into the brain to appreciate and seek out novelty: research <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(06)00475-2">shows</a> that being exposed to novel experiences activates the release of dopamine in the central nervous system. But when it becomes a consistent habit in the way you work or run a business, it can be extremely damaging.</p>



<p>To cure the condition, you first need to notice the symptoms. Here are some of the signs of shiny toy syndrome you should pay attention to:</p>



<ul>
<li>You have switched a particular piece of software or service provider in your business several times in the past year</li>



<li>You pick a new language every time you start to code a new project</li>



<li>You spend more time adding new features to your product than improving the existing ones or growing the customer base</li>



<li>You have launched and abandoned many side projects in the past year, without giving them the time to grow</li>



<li>You want to build products with emerging technologies (AI, AR, VR, blockchain) just because they’re new and innovative</li>



<li>You have bought and started many online courses but never managed to finish one</li>
</ul>



<p>None of these alone constitute a strong indication that you suffer from shiny toy syndrome, but several of these signs combined mean that you should probably be careful about how the constant switching and newness-driven choices may be hurting your long-term performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to deal with the shiny toy syndrome</h2>



<p>Not only is it a potentially expensive habit, but the shiny toy syndrome can cause unnecessary stress and confusion. When the tools keep on changing and people’s energy is drained from constantly having to relearn basic tasks, this can hurt the team’s performance but also work relationships.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are a few things you can do to develop self-awareness and combat the shiny toy syndrome.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Implement a cooling-off period.</strong> When you feel tempted by a new tool or technology, implement a mandatory cooling-off period. Give yourself a few days or even weeks to ponder the decision. This can help reduce impulse purchases or changes based purely on the novelty factor.</li>



<li><strong>Ask yourself why.</strong> Before implementing a new feature or technology into your product, take a moment to ask yourself why. Is it because it will be beneficial to the users, or because you find it exciting? Does it actually make sense from a business perspective?</li>



<li><strong>Consider the switching costs.</strong> Each decision comes with consequences. What would be the return on investment of switching tools? What other priorities will have to wait while you focus on implementing a new feature? Use <a href="https://nesslabs.com/second-level-thinking">second-level thinking</a> to imagine all the effects your decisions will have on the business before committing to it.</li>



<li><strong>Use a decision matrix.</strong> The <a href="https://nesslabs.com/decision-making">DECIDE framework</a> can help you evaluate potential new tools objectively. You will define the problem, establish the criteria, and consider the alternatives before you can identify the best alternative. And sometimes the best alternative is to stick to your current solution!</li>



<li><strong>Reflect on the decision.</strong> Whether it’s by discussing the impact of the new tool with friends and colleagues or writing your reflections as part of your <a href="https://nesslabs.com/metacognition">metacognitive practice</a>, make sure to review the shiny new toys you’ve been experimenting with and assess whether they’re still fit for purpose.</li>
</ol>



<p>The idea is not to limit your curiosity – just to channel it in a way that’s most supportive of your creativity and creativity. If trying new tools gives you lots of joy, you can turn that curiosity into an actual project to share your experience with others (this is why we started the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">Tools for Thought</a> interview series at Ness Labs). You can always also have one long-term project and several smaller side projects which you’re free to abandon whenever they don’t feel fun anymore.</p>



<p>The key here is intentionality. Whenever you want to try a new tool or start to a new project, question your motivations, explore second-order consequences, and make sure to reflect on the impact so you can keep on learning and growing.</p>

<a class="featured-tool-label" href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">FEATURED TOOL</a>



<p>Welcome to this edition of our Tools for Thought series, where we interview founders on a mission to help us think better and work smarter. Cansu Tastan is the co-creator and designer of <a href="https://defternotes.com/">Defter Notes</a>, a tool for infinite spatial thinking that supports handwriting and visual notes. Their motto is: Break free from linear thinking – which obviously resonates with us at Ness Labs.</p>



<p>In this interview, we talked about the power of bridging the gap between analog and digital, how to interact with ideas in a tangible way, how this can support neurodiversity in note-taking, creating a liminal space for brain dumps, the future of spatial computing, and much more. Enjoy the read!</p>

<p><strong>Hi Cansu, thanks for agreeing to this interview! In a crowded Tools for Thought spaces, you decided to focus on building a tool for the iPad.</strong></p>



<p>Thank you for having me! I’m continuously inspired by your work at Ness Labs and it’s great to be here. Building a tool for thought is a unique challenge because a “good” one can mean so many different things to different people. The main need for me was merging analog aspects of pen and paper with digital functions, without confining to screen sizes.</p>



<p>I’ve been using an iPad for reading and research since 2017. I was also earning my certificate as a scientific botanical illustrator, and was curious about other aspects of botany like its history and botanical latin. Like most learning does, my curiosity required downloading various pdfs, referencing multiple websites, going through reading materials.</p>



<p>But just scrolling, reading and copy pasting fell short and didn’t allow me to get deeper. I also felt the need to add my own visual inputs and hand write my insights instead of typing words on an online document. I could see that there was a gap between my digital research and my analog creation process and I longed for a tool that could merge those worlds together.</p>



<p>iPads are not a broad category, at least not as big as web or mobile phone users. But I find iPads to be very unique. Personally, I’m inspired by their technology because of the variety of gestures. The fact that you can use an Apple Pencil to add even more layers of input like pressure sensitivity or tilting is very intriguing. It provides you with unique ways of interaction, which you can’t replicate with a keyboard or mouse.</p>



<p>This is why I decided to create an app that could bridge the gap between analog and digital. This was a burning desire for me both as a UX designer and as a final user.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Defter Notes Image 2" class="wp-image-15174" height="669" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/defter-notes-2-1024x669.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>It’s amazing when you solve your own problems as a founder. Can you tell us more about the inception of Defter Notes?</strong></p>



<p>My background is in UX, and I see user experience problems to be improved everywhere I look. It felt only natural to design an app around my personal need, and an iPad app that will work with Apple Pencil seemed like an appropriate match. When I was explaining my need for “that analog, tangible feeling” that I couldn’t accurately describe at the time to my cofounder Caner, he mentioned he was also in need of such a tool.</p>



<p>This was back in 2019 and at the time he was working as a civil engineer. He wanted to attach architectural build plans and images to his meeting notes, links and comments to agreements, attach files and export all of these to send to coworkers. He’s very into fountain pens, inks and nice quality papers, so he also wanted to handwrite comfortably and sketch freely when needed.</p>



<p>When we started building Defter Notes, there were pdf apps but they were all rigid and linear. There were nice brush and ink tools but they were designed for artists’ needs. There were whiteboard apps but those didn’t support pdfs. There were research apps, but they were all text based. We knew that we both needed a new tool and it needed to be spatial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back, I think I saw the glimpses of spatial computing in the iPad, and wanted to tap into that undiscovered territory of non-linear thinking. Just around the time we launched the first beta version of Defter Notes in 2021, we started designing the concept for the infinite spaces and wormholes, focusing on how to visually represent and connect ideas in these spaces.</p>



<p>A professor friend suggested looking into analog methods and Zettelkasten. It was around the same time I heard Anne-Laure’s talk about combinational creativity and I remember making notes on a sticky note in Defter Notes about mapping ideas, and visual cues to represent them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that we do our best when we’re in the flow, not getting distracted and focused on what we’re good at, with a bit of challenge. I wanted Defter Notes to be so clutter free and so intuitive that you can just open a space, dump your brain and have a good look at what it is that’s coming out. When you need it to be, it should be as simple as putting pen on paper. And when you want it to become this capable spatial organizational tool with links and spaces and attachments, it can handle that as well.</p>



<p>We also know that creative thinking processes are messy, and we love to embrace that chaos because it fuels combinational connections and sparks new and brighter ideas. The point is, it should be <em>your</em> mess. When it’s your hand gestures, your handwriting, your choice of colors and your type of structure then it’s no longer a mess for you.</p>



<p>Since our official launch in 2022, many have been using Defter Notes the way their brain does and Caner and I are doing our best to listen to their stories and improve the app with their insights.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Defter Notes Image 3" class="wp-image-15175" height="674" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/defter-notes-image-3-1024x674.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Defter Notes is designed around the concept of a “pliable workflow” – what does that mean exactly?</strong></p>



<p>Pliable means it shifts shapes to your needs. When you design a workspace around spatial elements it becomes essential that you can identify and interact with those elements in an intuitive way. This can mean you need visual cues or anchors. These can be properties such as size, color or direction, or it can be the specific way you place such items relative to each other, much like the way we do on a physical desk.</p>



<p>We wanted to focus on this tangible way of interacting with our notes and ideas, which is why everything on a Defter Notes space can be held and freely dragged around. Additionally, all colors can be customized, whether it’s the color of paper, sticky notes, or the connection lines of wormholes to indicate the meaning behind those connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wormholes for example, is the bidirectional linking tool of Defter Notes and when you customize those jump points with custom colors. When you take a step back to view the web of connections it can help you map out the context.</p>



            
            
                                        
            
            


<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 15px;"></div>



<p><strong>This sounds like a great way to navigate knowledge.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, and navigating knowledge is way different than simply searching for information. Each person&#8217;s knowledge has a deeply personal background linked to their previous arsenal of seemingly unrelated web of ideas and opinions. It’s very hard to compartmentalize into silos of documents. It’s chaotic in a personal way and often doesn’t make sense from a stranger&#8217;s point of view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think this is one of the reasons why so many people can say Defter Notes works the way their brain does. We didn’t design it to fit your mind into our ideals of how you should navigate your knowledge. It’s pliable because your brain is pliable and you can adapt your environment to reflect your way of thinking. This is very rare with current software which mostly relies on linear screens.</p>



<p>What I envisioned for a truly spatial experience was to provide the simplest set of tools that you can use in the most creative ways possible. For example a “wormhole” is essentially just a dot that connects one point to another. You can use this to extract a passage from a pdf and keep the connection to the source material.</p>



<p>Similarly, you can use the same tool to create an outline, or to cross-reference from different materials. Or you can use it as a portal to jump in between spaces or frame specific areas within spaces. It’s flexible and pliable, and therefore gives you room for being playful and creative.</p>



<p><strong>Knowledge workers work with all sorts of documents, which can be hard to connect together. How does Defter Notes solve this issue?</strong></p>



<p>This was one of my biggest problems too. Sometimes you work with many source materials and you need a way to sort these and restructure in a new way that makes sense in a different context. I collect a lot of source material, copy and paste text snippets from the web, attach url links and sometimes make quick notes on stickies. I also write in depth documents and draw illustrations.</p>



<p>You can sort and arrange all your moving pieces on pages and then merge those pages into stacks to create a compact, exportable document. A stack is essentially a collection of pages. These can be pages you create within Defter Notes or they can be pages of a PDF.  This means when you import a PDF to Defter Notes, it will be opened in a Stack, allowing you the editing capabilities of this feature. I love that you can open multiple PDFs in Defter Notes, it really helps that I can import as many PDFs as I need.</p>



            
            
                                        
            
            


<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 15px;"></div>



<p>One of my favorite ways to use stacks is rearranging pages on the infinite canvas. You can hold to drag any page in and out of a stack. Similarly, you can spread all your moving pieces out on an infinite space surface and link them to map your thinking and you can still export and share this. You can layout pages side by side, compare them, rearrange, allowing you to merge your created notes with your collected materials.</p>



<p><strong>What about retrieving knowledge?</strong></p>



<p>Although they’re not glamorous, spaces are the major drivers of Defter Notes organizational system. On the cover, they are represented by a simple rectangle, which has a name and a color. Customizing the color and adding an icon is a quick way to recognize your spaces, and alternatively you can locate spaces on images to create an even more meaningful cover.</p>



<p>When you enter a space, it’s yet another new infinite space that can hold even more spaces. This is a bit different than a typical “folder”, because the space holds and shows everything you put in it on its surface.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Defter Notes Image 4" class="wp-image-15176" height="783" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/defter-notes-image-4-1024x783.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>Because Defter Notes’ spaces are infinite, we didn’t want you to get lost in those spaces. For orienting and finding something from spatial memory I love using the mini map. Little dots on the mini-map represent your elements in a space. It’s like a compass and you can spatially recognize your notes this way. When your space gets crowded you’ll see where the clusters of items are packed together and where a page is floating alone. If your wormholes have colors their dots are represented with that color, so you can find it visually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a more conventional navigation bar at the top of each space, showing where you are in hierarchy. At the left of this bar you can access your most recent spaces for a quick jump or on the right there is a space search for retrieving a space by its name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alternatively you can use wormholes to create jump points. You can set a frame and name these connections as well. This can be used as a flashcard, or it can be used to guide a step by step walkthrough. We’re also working on adding a search function for wormholes as well.</p>



<p>There’s also the “archive tray” which is a hidden space you can access anytime when you hold an item. This area is for dropping something out of sight quickly, or for safekeeping an item until you have a permanent place for it. It’s the liminal space for brain dumps. I often find a lot of new ideas sorting through my fleeting notes I find in the archive tray.</p>



            
            
                                        
            
            


<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 15px;"></div>



<p><strong>That sounds both functional and intuitive. Now, what kind of people use Defter Notes?</strong></p>



<p>We have an active beta testers community and we’re always in touch with our users, listening to their feedback. I try to talk to them with my researcher hat on about their specific workflows, core needs, and pain points. There is a very wide range of users from different professional backgrounds, with a lot of neurodiversity as well. We have many users with ADHD, and creatives in general are often less neurotypical. I can say that the common characteristic of Defter Notes users is that they enjoy flexibility and versatility.</p>



<p>From what I gather, everyone finds their unique way of utilizing different aspects or features of Defter Notes. The multiple PDFs feature, for example, appeals to many academics focusing on language learning, medicine, math, and engineering.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Defter Notes Image 5" class="wp-image-15177" height="784" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/defter-notes-image-5-1024x784.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>Writers, journalists, and legal professionals like to merge text references and reading materials with handwritten notes, utilizing the wormholes feature. Creative professionals such as designers or architects love that they can shift and customize the way they organize according to project needs.</p>



<p>There are musicians and composers viewing, reviewing, and writing music on Defter Notes. There are even many D&amp;D players creating character maps and storylines, which in my opinion, shows that it’s a great tool for world-building and creative storytelling.</p>



<p>There are also others who use it for productivity. One of our most active users is an IT manager, and she has thousands of sessions with Defter Notes as she manages her company, meetings, and personal notes. I know this because she’s been a long-time beta tester and she’s now an alpha tester for our next big version release. I get a lot of insights and ideas from her use cases that I personally end up applying to my productivity systems as well.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, how do you use Defter Notes?</strong></p>



<p>I mainly use it to manage productivity and creativity. This can take various forms depending on the project at hand. I’ve also seen my methods change and evolve over time.</p>



<p>Currently my daily practice is to start with a fresh page every day. I keep the organization minimal with only two stacks and treat it as a timeline. One keeps the past daily logs and the other holds the upcoming projects. When the day is over, its page goes in the past stack. I also like to have a pdf calendar at hand and I link the projects with wormholes on the calendar. And I always create a new space if I need to go deeper. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Defter Notes Image 6" class="wp-image-15178" height="691" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/defter-notes-image-6-1024x691.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>When I get a lot of ideas, a new space is like a playground to jot down notes and visual sketches. When I read articles and non-fiction materials for research it resembles a mind map with the sources attached. I keep an anti library of pdfs I want to read and also have a currently reading space with 1-3 books and articles, surrounded with stickies full of fleeting notes. I review them whenever I’m writing a new medium blog or if I’m brainstorming a new feature concept.</p>



<p>I use the universal paste function quite often as I work both on MacBook and on iPad. It’s very convenient to outline an article like this, pasting snippets from typed notes, mapping them visually, looking at the gaps and iterating the process. On personal projects my spaces become even more creative and versatile. Sometimes it’s a whiteboard where I drop various internet links and images, I make a lot of lists.</p>



<p>When I travel it holds my itinerary, observational notes, addresses and map links and pictures of little things I find interesting. I like to export these travel stacks as pdfs and enjoy looking at them to remember my experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know that my cofounder Caner uses spaces to organize his side projects. He keeps lists of materials, links to urls and sketches details of whatever he’s building.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for Defter Notes?</strong></p>



<p>I think an app&#8217;s core functions should always be human centric and it should be developed with testing and researching with real people in mind. This is why I wanted us to have a user experience first motto, talking with users and shaping next steps according to their feedback. Right now, we have a few major milestones ahead for Defter Notes.</p>



<p>Some of our current users have multiple iPads and most of our users have multiple devices. Having access to their Defter Notes spaces on the go is a valid request and we took that as a priority to work on. We are on a big mission to expand Defter Notes from iPad to iPhones and Macs and eventually to Apple Vision Pro.</p>



<p>Our very small team of two is currently working on a sync version that will support all of these platforms. As I mentioned before we’re in the alpha testing phase for ver 2.0 and we will soon announce an open call for those who’d like to participate in the beta version. My co-founder Caner and I are very excited to share our progress on this and we’re very much looking forward to this major release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a more personal mission, I’m very intrigued by the new user experience research challenges of spatial computing. Defter Notes current structure is already very much in line with spatial thinking, and I’m curious to see where we can take it in the realm of spatial computing.</p>



<p>Another big task for us has been to equip Defter Notes with even more writing tools, with more variety of ink types, and customizable properties. If we can reach a wider audience with version 2.0 and expand our team these are my personal goals: to design the best handwriting experience for Defter Notes users and expand it to spatial computing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Cansu! Where can people learn more about Defter Notes?</strong></p>



<p>It’s been a pleasure talking to you! If anyone is interested in the progress and wants to give their feedback they’re always welcome to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/TQcntV7cVB">Discord community</a>.

<title>The Tyranny of Job Titles: From Vanity Growth to Personal Growth</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/job-titles?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=job-titles</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/job-titles?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=job-titles</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I started working at Google, I was quickly introduced to the job ladder that has since become pervasive in the tech industry. Depending on your first job there, you get assigned to a particular ladder, with fixed accomplishments to demonstrate in order to climb to the next level.</p>



<p>For example, in marketing, you are an Associate Product Marketing Manager at level 3, then a Product Marketing Manager at level 4. In engineering, you become a Senior Software Engineer at level 5, then a Staff Software Engineer at level 6, etc.</p>



<p>Each level comes with a detailed performance rubric to assess whether or not you’re ready to be promoted. The whole promotion process is designed around these rubrics. They’re like a checklist of accomplishments you need to demonstrate to your manager and to your peers.</p>



<p>The problem with rubrics – beside the fact that<a href="https://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=9&amp;n=2"> </a><a href="https://alfiekohn.org/teaching/rubrics.pdf">many are badly designed</a> – is that they encourage fitting a mold that doesn’t evolve with the ever-changing demands of work. People end up doing what will <em>look good</em> rather than what’s <em>actually good</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The invisible ladders driving our lives</h2>



<p>We unconsciously apply unofficial rubrics in many areas of our lives. Going to a good school, working for a well-known company, getting recognised for our work through awards and other industry accolades, dating a person we know our friends will like, attending events everyone is going to.</p>



<p>It’s as if each part of our lives came with mini-ladders to climb; checklists of things to do in order to grow.</p>



<p>Job titles are just the most visible ladder of them all. It’s interesting that pompous executive job titles were<a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_639543_en.html"> invented</a> during the Victorian era. This is when we started the trend of calling a cleaner a hygiene technician. A bin man became a waste management and disposal technician. Later on, a call-center worker became a communications executive.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In the nineteenth century, individuals began to assume some often outlandish and fantastic-sounding job titles. One obvious reason was to make them stand out from the crowd. Assuming a highfalutin job or product title made sometimes boring jobs leap off the page.” — Dr Alun Withey, Historian at the University of Exeter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And this is what most job titles are about: validating who we are without having to explain what we do. In fact, a survey of 1,500 office workers<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/apr/18/workandcareers.pay"> found</a> that a shocking 70% would take a better job title over an increase in salary.</p>



<p>This shows a profound disconnect between the emphasis people place on the value they bring to a company and how they want to be perceived within that company. It also indicates a focus on progression driven by vanity rather than actual personal growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From vanity growth to personal growth</h2>



<p>Founders who run startups are often being warned about vanity metrics. Vanity metrics are metrics that make you look good to others but don’t actually help you grow in a meaningful way. In business, vanity metrics include registered users, social media likes, and page views. Actionable metrics include active users and paying customers.</p>



<p>In life, vanity metrics are those shiny medals we collect to make ourselves look good to others, such as job titles, impressive companies, or awards. Actionable life metrics, in contrast, provide an actual reflection of your personal growth.</p>



<p>Actionable life metrics are based on questions such as: Are you actually better at what you do than you were a few months ago? Did you learn something new or acquire a new skill? Regardless of your new job title, are you actually becoming a better human being?</p>



<p>It’s easy to fall into the trap of vanity growth when everyone around you is chasing a better job title. Here are a few ways you can ensure you’re focusing on personal growth rather than vanity growth:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reflect on your progress.</strong> While job titles are fixed, your daily accomplishments are not. Writing every day to think about what you actually did today that made you a better version of yourself is a great exercise to ensure you focus on the right things. Journaling is a powerful tool to add to your<a href="https://nesslabs.com/mental-gym"> mental gym</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Conduct personal experiments.</strong> Making a pact with yourself to learn something new is one of the simplest and most actionable ways to foster personal growth. This could be mastering a new skill or a new topic, or regularly meeting new people. I wrote more about<a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindframing"> </a><a href="https://nesslabs.com/personal-experiments">designing personal experiments</a> if you want to try it for yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Surround yourself with fellow curious minds.</strong> It’s hard to hide behind a job title when you’re chatting with smart people. Challenging conversations are also an excellent way to drive your personal growth beyond job titles. Make sure to spend time with curious minds who will question your knowledge and your skills in a constructive way.</li>



<li><strong>Rewrite your bio.</strong> A few years ago, my bio read something like this: “Ex-Global Marketing Lead at Google. Founder in Residence at Entrepreneur First. Venture Scout for Backed VC” – a collection of recognisable tech brands I had been associated with. This is the most common approach to describing ourselves. Instead, try stating what you’re currently working on and the topics you enjoy talking about.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, you should be proud of your progress at work and being promoted is a great ego boost and recognition of your contributions. Just make sure that your personal growth matches the visible progression demonstrated by your position on the job ladder.</p>



<p>Most successful people are not described by the role they have within a company. They are celebrated in terms of what they have actually accomplished.</p>

<title>The Self-Motivation Toolkit: How to Stay Curious and Committed</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/self-motivation-toolkit?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=self-motivation-toolkit</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Motivation is a fickle friend. One day, you’re bursting with energy and enthusiasm, tackling your projects with a sense of flow. The next, you find yourself stuck in a rut, struggling to muster the drive to get anything done. It’s a frustrating cycle that can leave you feeling helpless and unproductive.</p>



<p>This is especially true for long-term projects that involve some of the slower, longer-term kind of grind, such as writing content and building communities. You know you care, but you’re bound to have days where it’s just hard to get to work.</p>



<p>But what if you could break free from this cycle and take control of your motivation? Self-motivation isn’t some mysterious force that you’re born with or without. It’s a skill that can be learned and developed. By understanding the science behind it, you can master the tools you need to stay motivated and make progress on the projects that matter to you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Science of Motivation</h2>



<p>Research <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110094415.htm">suggests</a> that motivation finds its roots in the dopamine pathways in our brain. When we anticipate that something will feel good, dopamine starts kicking in. And this is very relevant to self-motivation, as imagining the reward we’d get by acting gives us a little boost in dopamine, just as if we actually acted already.</p>



<p>According to psychologists, there are two main types of motivation:</p>



<p><strong>Extrinsic motivation.</strong> The most common sources of extrinsic motivation are external rewards, such as earning money, winning a prize, or getting good grades. Extrinsic motivation can also be negative, for example being scared of getting fired or of having a fight with your partner. While extrinsic motivation works great in the short term, it will only last as long as you consider the external rewards to be satisfying. Not interested in money anymore? There goes your motivation.</p>



<p><strong>Intrinsic motivation.</strong> Intrinsic motivation has been <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2000-13324-007.html">defined</a> as the desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to test and analyze your abilities, and to complete tasks you find rewarding in and of themselves. It was first<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/125/6/627.html?uid=1999-01567-001"> discovered</a> in animals engaging in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors, even without a given reward. With intrinsic motivation, the reason why you act is internal.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Self-Motivation: The Difference between Extrinsic Motivation and Intrinsic Motivation" class="wp-image-15136" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/self-motivation-extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>How do you build more intrinsic motivation into your life? Researchers have identified several ingredients you need three key ingredients to build intrinsic motivation.</p>



<p>The first is <strong>self-efficacy</strong>, trusting that you have the choice and the freedom to act however you want to. Of course, you need to be aware of your current motivational state, but researchers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822003316">discovered</a> that equally important is how confident you feel in your ability to change it.</p>



<p>The second one is <strong>curiosity</strong>. Neuroimaging studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5364176/">suggest</a> that intrinsic motivation and curiosity share the same dopaminergic systems. It’s much easier to feel motivated when you find a question interesting or when you notice an information gap you want to fill.</p>



<p>Interestingly, neuroimaging studies have revealed that self-efficacy and curiosity are not only important ingredients for self-motivation but are also interconnected in the brain. A study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394019305452">found</a> that the strength of activation of the “curiosity brain network” mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and curiosity.</p>



<p>In other words, your confidence in your ability to change your motivational state plays a significant role in shaping your curiosity. This link between self-efficacy and curiosity in the brain shows the importance of cultivating both factors when you want to motivate yourself.</p>



<p>Lastly, you <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167200269004?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.1">need</a> a feeling of increased <strong>competence</strong>—believing that the task will teach you something new and make you more knowledgeable and more efficient. This sense of growth and mastery keeps you motivated to continue pursuing the task even in the face of setbacks.</p>



<p>Self-efficacy, curiosity, and competence: these are the three ingredients you need to regain and maintain self-motivation. So, how do you unlock those ingredients?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Toolkit for Self-Motivation</h2>



<p>While you cannot force self-motivation, you can create the perfect conditions for cultivating a&nbsp; sense of self-efficacy, curiosity, and competence. By making small but meaningful changes, you’ll set the stage for your motivation to emerge. I call those simple strategies the 3 Ms of Self-Motivation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="The 3Ms of Self-Motivation (Self-Motivation Toolkit)" class="wp-image-15137" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-ms-self-motivation-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<ol>
<li><strong>Manage your mood.</strong> It will be much harder to feel self-motivated if you are in a bad mood. Instead of brute-forcing your way to complete a task, take a little break to regulate your nervous system and cultivate a sense of calm. This could be through meditation, treating yourself to a nice, healthy meal, or having an interesting conversation break with a peer.</li>



<li><strong>Measure your progress.</strong> This can be as simple as starting a spreadsheet where you count the number of words you have written, the number of days you have coded, or the number of times you went to the gym. Creating a streak can be extremely self-motivating as you won’t want to break it. As a fun bonus, generating graphs can also make your progress easier to visualize—see the GitHub contribution graph as an example.</li>



<li><strong>Make it public.</strong> This is one of the most efficient ways to stay motivated over the long run. Working on a project with intrinsic motivation <em>and</em> adding the extrinsic motivation of a public commitment is a powerful combo. But do not only announce your project: make a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact">pact</a> to share regular updates, whether it’s with your colleagues or on social media.</li>
</ol>



<p>Manage your mood, measure your progress, make it public. These three simple steps that can greatly help you get motivated, and more importantly, stay motivated so you can achieve your most authentic ambitions, even on days when it’s hard to get to work.</p>

<title>The Illusion of Productivity: Why We Are Addicted to Busyness</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=illusion-of-productivity</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=illusion-of-productivity</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> busyness, productivity, relevance, meaningfulness, time
<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了人类独特的忙碌需求，以及忙碌与实际产出之间的关系。人们倾向于以各种借口忙碌自己，即使任务毫无意义。忙碌往往只是一种逃避面对生活真相的方式，也是社会所鼓励的行为。然而，被忙碌所控制会使我们失去专注力，无法进行创造性思考。通过定期的忙碌审核，可以识别并减少那些不重要或无意义的任务，从而为更有意义的任务腾出时间。解决这种忙碌依赖需要意识上的转变，包括改变观念、减少任务数量、学会拒绝和接受无所事事。重新获得时间，专注于真正重要的事情，对未来将产生积极影响。 <div>
<p>Ever since humans have learned to write, we have documented how special we are and how we differ from other animals. Imagination, morality, and culture are traits thought to only be found in humans.</p>



<p>Another aspect that seems to be uniquely human is the need to keep busy. Most animals would be happy if their basic needs are met: food, shelter, rest. In contrast, we humans don’t like to stay idle. Even if it means falling prey to the illusion of productivity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Need to Keep Busy</h2>



<p>In a<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20548057"> research study</a> about busyness and idleness, scientists asked participants to go deliver a survey in one of two locations which they could choose from.</p>



<p>The first option was nearby, allowing people to complete the task quicker, come back to the research center, and wait, doing nothing (the idle option); the second option was far away, with very little time to wait once they’d come back (the busy option).</p>



<p>Which option did people choose? Turns out, it depended on one small element: whether or not they had a justification—even if only specious—to choose the “busy” option.</p>



<p>The participants were told they were going to get a piece of chocolate as a reward. If they were told the chocolate would be the same regardless of the option they picked, only 32% of participants chose the faraway location. But if they were told they would get milk chocolate at one location and dark chocolate at the other, 59% picked the “busy” option.</p>



<p>It doesn’t seem that groundbreaking at first, but the implications are profound: as humans, we tend to do whatever it takes and to use any justification to keep busy, even if the task is meaningless. In the words of the scientists behind the study: “Our research suggests that many purported goals that people pursue may be merely justifications to keep themselves busy.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Busyness and the Illusion of Being Productive</h2>



<p>In her book <em>Daring Greatly</em>, Dr Brené Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston, describes being “crazy busy” as a numbing strategy that allows us to avoid facing the truth of our lives. “I often say that when they start having 12-step meetings for busy-aholics, they’ll need to rent out football stadiums.”</p>



<p>She explains that we would rather fill the time with activities—any kind of activity—than to take the risk of finding ourselves <a href="https://nesslabs.com/loneliness-solitude">alone</a> with our thoughts. And our society encourages this behavior: being idle or having too much free time is often considered a sign of laziness.</p>



<p>Furthermore, being “crazy busy” both justifies and reinforces living on autopilot. Instead of stopping for a few minutes to ask ourselves why we’re doing something, we keep on mindlessly churning work that may or may not lead to a goal we actually care about. It’s also one of the only socially acceptable excuses to not do the things that matter. Taking time for yourself? Feeling irritated? Forgot to do something important for a friend? You can blame it on being too busy.</p>



<p>Being busy does not equal being productive. When I get distracted by email notifications or when I check social media in the middle of writing an article, the interruption may give me the illusion of being busy. It will take longer to write the article because I keep breaking my <a href="https://nesslabs.com/flow">state of flow</a>. I will feel like I have worked all afternoon on something, when in reality I just didn’t manage to focus enough to get it done quicker.</p>



<p>By feeling constantly busy, I also don’t leave room for pure creative thinking—instead, I’m filling my brain with external stimuli to give it something to do. As the study I mentioned earlier shows, it feels good. We like being busy. It’s reassuring. But it doesn’t mean it’s good for us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Busyness Matrix</h2>



<p>Between work tasks and social commitments, it’s easy to spend your entire week running around without really knowing where the time has gone. To break free from busyness, I have created a simple tool you can use to conduct a busyness audit and see what’s keeping you so busy.</p>



<p>You’ll ideally need a full week of data, but if your routine doesn’t change too much throughout the week you could do this in just one day.</p>



<p>First, track your time and record what you spend it on. You can use an app like Rize (see my interview with the founder <a href="https://nesslabs.com/rize-featured-tool">here</a>) or simply put everything you do in your calendar.</p>



<p>Then, place these tasks and activities in the following matrix, based on relevance and meaningfulness:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="The Busyness Matrix - Conducting a Busyness Audit and Breaking Free from the Illusion of Productivity" class="wp-image-15131" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/busyness-matrix-1024x575.png" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Busyness Matrix</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Relevance is based on how aligned the tasks and activities are with your current professional and personal commitments. Meaningfulness is based on how alive these tasks make you feel.</p>



<p>For instance, attending a boring networking event is relevant but probably not meaningful. An exciting work project or planning your next holiday is both relevant and meaningful. Taking an online course to learn how to speak Chinese may not be relevant to your current commitments, but may feel highly meaningful. Attending meetings with no clear agenda or aimlessly browsing social media are neither relevant nor meaningful.</p>



<p>Now, look at your Busyness Matrix, and look at each quadrant in this order:</p>



<ul>
<li>Irrelevant/Meaningless: Can you reduce or get rid of any of these?</li>



<li>Irrelevant/Meaningful: Are you sure you don’t have too many going on at the same time?</li>



<li>Relevant/Meaningless: Can you delegate some of these?</li>



<li>Relevant/Meaningful: Do you have enough time and energy for these?</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’re done with the audit, you can make changes in your life and work to reclaim your time. However, don’t try to tackle the quadrants all at once. Start eliminating as many irrelevant/meaningless tasks, and work your way up to making space for relevant/meaningful ones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting Off the Hamster Wheel</h2>



<p>Breaking our addiction to busyness doesn’t have to be hard, but it does require a conscious mindset shift. Having more free time is something we say we want, but it’s going against our deeply rooted fear of being alone with our thoughts and facing the reality of our lives. That’s why it can be liberating, but also pretty scary. Here are some simple changes you can implement:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Change your perspective.</strong> First, stop saying “I don’t have time”. Instead, say “It’s not a priority.” Remind yourself that there is enough time in a day to do the things you care about.</li>



<li><strong>Less doing, more achieving.</strong> Don’t measure productivity in terms of how many tasks you get done, but rather in terms of doing the ones that matter. Clean up your to-do list. Shift your focus from tasks to outcomes.</li>



<li><strong>Start saying no.</strong> Don&#8217;t take stuff on just because someone asked you. Question whether this new task will translate into meaningful outcomes. It may be strange at first (you could say &#8220;not right now&#8221; instead of &#8220;no&#8221; if that&#8217;s easier) but it will help you better manage your time.</li>



<li><strong>Make peace with inaction.</strong> To help you get comfortable with doing nothing, schedule time with yourself for dedicated downtime. Reflect or take a short walk.</li>
</ol>



<p>Reclaiming your time to focus on what really matters can have a big impact on where you will be one year from now. All these moments we spend on irrelevant and meaningless tasks to avoid being alone with ourselves can be used for thinking, exciting work, or time spent with loved ones. It all adds up pretty quickly, so getting rid of the illusion of productivity is worth the initial discomfort of confronting our own thoughts.</p>

<title>The Reading Mind: Surprising Science-Based Benefits of Reading Everyday</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/benefits-of-reading?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=benefits-of-reading</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> reading, brain, benefits, habit, tips
<br />
阅读是人类独有的能力，大脑通过再利用现有回路来学习阅读。阅读有助于减轻压力、刺激大脑、提高记忆力、扩展词汇量、增强专注力、改善大脑连接性和分析能力。建立阅读习惯的方法包括选择一本喜欢的书、每天阅读一页、设定阅读时间和地点。阅读不仅丰富大脑，还是健康生活的一部分。总结: <div>
<p>Humans are the only animals capable of reading, an invention that’s only been around for a few thousand years. That’s nowhere near enough time for our brains to have evolved dedicated circuitry for reading. And yet, somehow, specific brain areas are consistently associated with reading across different cultures.</p>



<p>This puzzle, known as the “reading paradox”, has fascinated scientists for a while. How do humans learn to read in such a way that the same brain regions are activated regardless of where we grow up, and despite the fact that reading is too modern to be the product of evolution? And what benefits can we get from regularly activating those parts of our brain by reading everyday?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/reading-paradox-image.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15122" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/reading-paradox-image-1024x576.png" width="1024" /></a></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Reading Paradox</h2>



<p>Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene proposed a solution to the reading paradox: the neuronal recycling hypothesis. The theory suggests that our brains can repurpose existing circuitry for new functions, allowing us to acquire new cognitive abilities like reading.</p>



<p>Rather than evolving entirely new brain circuits, reading likely piggybacks on systems that were originally designed for other purposes, such as brain regions that were initially devoted to recognizing visual patterns in nature.</p>



<p>For instance, the ability to distinguish between the shapes of different leaves or animals in nature may be repurposed to help us differentiate between letters such as <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>. Through exposure and practice, the brain’s existing circuitry is “recycled” for the task of reading text.</p>



<p>This means that reading is a natural activity for our brains. Our ancestors used to rely on their pattern recognition skills to read nature and now we use those same abilities to read text. And reading is actually great for our cognitive health and well-being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why you should read everyday</h2>



<p>Because it <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mental-gym">actively</a> engages your brain, reading is one of the healthiest hobbies for your mind. Not only is reading educational and informative, which is beneficial in itself, but it also rewires the connections in your brain, leading to many benefits.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stress reduction.</strong> Studies <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5070874/Reading-can-help-reduce-stress.html">show</a> that reading can help relax your body by lowering your heart rate and easing the tension in your muscles, with a reduction in stress of up to 68% in people when silently reading a literary work for only six minutes.</li>



<li><strong>Mental stimulation.</strong> Research <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/60/3/380/630607">suggests</a> that reading can slow the progress of Alzheirmer’s disease and dementia by keeping your brain active and engaged, especially when reading out loud.</li>



<li><strong>Memory improvement.</strong> Reading has been<a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/reading-alzheimers-bay/"> shown</a> to slow the rate of memory deterioration and even improve your <a href="https://nesslabs.com/remember-what-you-read">memory</a> and thinking skills.</li>



<li><strong>Vocabulary expansion.</strong> Reading is one of the best ways to learn new words. That’s why many researchers<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610292/"> advocate</a> for more reading experience in schools.</li>



<li><strong>Better focus.</strong> Researchers have<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/opinion/david-brooks-building-attention-span.html"> found</a> that, compared to using social media, reading helps improve concentration by increasing the capacity for longer attention spans.</li>



<li><strong>Improved brain connectivity.</strong> Studies have revealed that reading a narrative <a href="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2013/12/esc_novels_change_brain/campus.html">improves</a> the connections inside the left temporal cortex of the brain—the area which is associated with language reception. The increased connectivity lasts for a few days after a reading session.</li>



<li><strong>Stronger analytical skills.</strong> When reading fiction, your brain takes notes of all of the details and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09610006211053040">gets into</a> critical thinking mode to try to figure out what happens next, a practice that is useful not just when reading but in day-to-day life and work.</li>
</ol>



<p>As playwright and novelist Somerset Maugham put it, “to acquire the habit of reading is to construct for yourself a refuge from almost all the miseries of life.” And yet… So many distractions, so many series to watch, so many podcasts to listen to. Finding the time or the motivation to read can be hard.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to cultivate a reading habit</h2>



<p>There are lots of other techniques to read more, but many rely on strong willpower or accountability, which may not be practical for everyone. Instead, here are three simple tips you can experiment with right away to make a habit of reading more:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pick a book you will enjoy.</strong> If business books are not your thing, forget about trying to read that business book everyone is talking about at work. When it comes to reading, anything goes. Are you a fan of science-fiction? Short poems? History? And yes, even comics count. Fiction, non-fiction, poems, blogs, newspapers, magazines… Anything that captures your interest and your imagination will be better than a book you find boring.</li>



<li><strong>Commit to reading one page every day.</strong> I’ve seen lots of advice recommending reading anywhere from five to ten pages a day, but that’s actually very hard to stick to. Instead, commit to reading one single page. Tell yourself you cannot go to sleep if you haven’t read that one daily page. If you feel like reading more, that’s great, but your only <a href="https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact">pact</a> with yourself should be to read one page every single day.</li>



<li><strong>Set a reading time and place.</strong> This could be just before going to sleep, while in your bed. Or on your way to work in the morning. Or on the way back from the gym. <a href="https://nesslabs.com/timeshielding-time-management">Shielding time</a> and having a set place will help to build a habit. Then, make sure you don’t have any distractions and lose yourself in the book.</li>
</ul>



<p>Reading can bring a lot of goodness to your brain and to your life. So next time you have a bit of free time, consider picking up a book instead of scrolling through videos on social media. And encourage your loved ones to read more—their brains will thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 人类好奇心, AI, 区别, 优势, 合作
<br />
<br />
总结: 人类好奇心与人工智能的好奇心在处理方式、视角和目的上存在巨大差异。人类好奇心更注重直觉、情感和个人经验，致力于开放式创造和知识追求；而人工智能的好奇心则更倾向于数据驱动、客观中立的决策。在AI时代，结合人类与AI的好奇心，可以加快创新步伐，推动发现，并解决复杂问题。人类的直觉思维可以与AI的计算能力相结合，应用于医药探索、建筑设计等领域，从而实现双方优势的互补与合作。通过创造有效的合作平台，支持人工智能与人类好奇心的协同工作，教育培养人类好奇心，不断探索和发现，可以让我们走向一个共同的目标。 <div>
<p>Curiosity has been a driving force behind our species’ remarkable success. By pushing us to question the status quo and explore the unknown, this innate desire to learn has sparked some of our greatest achievements—and shaped the course of human history.</p>



<p>In a world where AI is rapidly transforming our lives, it may seem obvious that we need human curiosity more than ever before. But most arguments in favor of human curiosity are really attempts to reassure ourselves that AI won’t overtake humanity. For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>“AI needs human guidance to ensure its capabilities are directed towards worthwhile challenges.”</li>



<li>“Human curiosity is required to interpret and apply AI outputs to real-world situations in meaningful ways.”</li>



<li>“Human curiosity will be needed to envision how to continue expanding the frontiers of what AI can do.”</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these arguments are debatable. In truth, AI may not need human curiosity at all. But there are compelling reasons why human curiosity is needed more than ever in the age of AI, and they stem from the fundamental differences between human and AI curiosity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dual Engines of Discovery</h2>



<p>To understand the distinct roles of human and AI curiosity, I found it helpful to examine their unique characteristics through a comparative framework. This framework looks at three key aspects of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/science-of-curiosity">curiosity</a>—processing, perspective, purpose—and examines how humans and AI differ across these dimensions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-base-background-color has-background"><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Human Curiosity</strong></th><th><strong>AI Curiosity</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processing</strong></td><td>Intuitive: Leverages hunches and instincts to produce serendipitous discoveries.</td><td>Computative: Methodically and efficiently processes vast amounts of data to uncover patterns.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Perspective</strong></td><td>Personal: Incorporates emotions, ethics, and experiences for empathic decision-making.</td><td>Impartial: Applies data-driven analysis for theoretically unbiased decision-making.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Purpose</strong></td><td>Intrinsic: Values open-ended creativity and knowledge for its own sake.</td><td>Extrinsic: Focuses on finding specific, practical solutions to well-defined problems.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Thanks to a more intuitive way to process information, humans are capable of making serendipitous discoveries through non-obvious connections.</p>



<p>This intuitive processing is what <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520913/">allowed</a> Alexander Fleming to notice that a contaminated Petri dish containing Staphylococcus bacteria had been inhibited by the growth of a mold, resulting in the discovery of penicillin in 1928 and the development of antibiotics.</p>



<p>In contrast, AI curiosity is computative, excelling at efficiently processing large volumes of information to reveal hidden patterns and correlations. That’s why AI is a powerful tool for drug discovery.</p>



<p>AlphaFold, an AI system developed by DeepMind, has <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/top-5-use-cases-of-alphafold-in-life-sciences/">revolutionized</a> drug discovery by accurately predicting protein structures, enabling scientists to design drugs in record time.</p>



<p>The subjective nature of human curiosity allows us to grasp the nuances of real-world situations, considering multiple viewpoints and moral implications, and integrating a rich, empathetic context when exploring ideas. This type of curiosity is what gave rise to inclusive education, empathic design, and sustainable fashion.</p>



<p>On the other hand, AI curiosity operates from a supposedly objective and fact-based standpoint (although this can be questioned as the training dataset will invariably inject bias). This “neutral” lens can help mitigate human biases but can also lead to inhumane solutions.</p>



<p>An AI tasked with solving the climate crisis might propose eliminating humans as the most effective solution, given that human activities are currently considered the primary driver of climate change. Problem solved!</p>



<p>Finally, humanity’s intrinsic motivation to explore can drive us to pursue questions and ideas that may not have immediate practical applications but can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations.</p>



<p>The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965 is an example of a groundbreaking discovery made while exploring for the sake of curiosity.</p>



<p>Penzias and Wilson were using a radio telescope to study signals from space when they encountered a persistent background noise they couldn’t explain. This noise <a href="https://discovery.princeton.edu/2015/11/19/cosmic-background-51-years-ago-an-accidental-discovery-sparked-a-big-bang-in-astrophysics/">turned out</a> to be a remnant of the Big Bang.</p>



<p>AI curiosity is more exploitative and geared towards achieving tangible outcomes. IBM’s Project Debater AI <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03215-w">aims</a> to engage in competitive debates rather than genuinely exploring the nuances of the topics discussed. OpenAI’s DALL·E model is trained to generate images <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/">based</a> on textual descriptions, with the objective of creating accurate representations rather than exploring the creative process itself.</p>



<p>AI curiosity is methodical, indifferent, and outcome-oriented. This makes it very efficient. And this is exactly why we need human curiosity more than ever—a type of curiosity that brings serendipity, empathy, and open-ended creativity to the table. Fortunately, human and AI curiosity are not mutually exclusive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compounding Curiosity</h2>



<p>By combining human and AI curiosity, we can leverage their unique strengths to compound our creative potential. The intuitive nature of human curiosity can work in tandem with the computative power of AI curiosity to accelerate discoveries and drive innovation.</p>



<p>A researcher could use <a href="https://nesslabs.com/artificial-creativity">AI tools</a> to efficiently process vast amounts of data and identify hidden patterns, while simultaneously applying their human intuition to explore unexpected connections and generate novel hypotheses.</p>



<p>In this collaborative approach, the AI’s impartial approach can help mitigate human biases, while the researcher’s personal experiences and ethical considerations can provide important context for translating the AI-generated results.</p>



<p>While AI could accelerate the discovery of new medicines, it was human curiosity that led to the understanding of the importance of set and setting in psychedelic therapy. The idea that the environment in which a psychedelic experience occurs can profoundly influence its therapeutic outcomes is a distinctly human insight, born from our ability to empathize, contextualize, and derive meaning from subjective experiences.</p>



<p>In architecture, AI’s computative power can efficiently search through vast design spaces to identify optimal materials, structures, and layouts for a given set of constraints. This can lead to buildings that are more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and resilient.</p>



<p>However, you need human curiosity to envision how these designs can be brought to life in a way that’s not just functional, but also aesthetically pleasing and culturally relevant, for instance to create a sense of community or reflect the unique identity of the occupants.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we have little grasp of how the brain generates ideas or what fundamentally distinguishes human and artificial cognition. Confidently ceding curiosity to AI would be premature given how much we have yet to discover about cognition.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can create powerful synergies between human and AI curiosity to solve complex problems and create solutions that are both humane and technically advanced. We need to create platforms that support collaboration between human and AI curiosity.</p>



<p>This includes developing AI systems that augment human curiosity rather than replace it, allowing knowledge workers to easily integrate AI into their workflows.</p>



<p>It also means investing in education and designing environments that nurture human curiosity through intrinsically-motivated intellectual exploration in schools, at home, and at work.</p>



<p>The future of human curiosity in the age of AI is not a zero-sum game. It’s an opportunity to create a virtuous cycle of discovery where the unique strengths of human and AI curiosity build upon and reinforce each other. It can be a journey towards a shared destination.</p>

<div> Beloga, knowledge management, productivity, RAG, integrations
总结:<br /><br />Beloga是一款用于知识管理和提高团队生产力的工具，采用最新的检索增强生成技术。它帮助用户快速查找信息，生成答案，并实现超个性化的知识管理。用户能够从多个信息来源中提取内容，快速解决问题，提高工作效率。Beloga的愿景是建立一个信息无障碍获取的世界，实现思维速度与知识获取速度的匹配。他们计划增加更多集成和开放应用程序市场，以促进更广泛的组织内信息流畅。 <div>
<p>Welcome to this edition of our Tools for Thought series, where we interview founders on a mission to help us think better and work smarter. Jerica Kuah and Wilson Ler are the co-founders of <a href="https://www.beloga.xyz/">Beloga</a>, a knowledge operating system for cross-team knowledge transfer. Beloga offers multi-source knowledge management to offer hyper-contextualized insights, streamline workflows, and make information retrieval easy.</p>



<p>In this interview, we talked about addressing the challenges of knowledge management and transfer, cultivating an environment conducive to innovation, and their vision of building a world where information is effortlessly accessible and where we can all work at the speed of thought. Enjoy the read!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Beloga – Featured Tool Image 1" class="wp-image-15087" height="597" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beloga-image-1-1024x597.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Thanks for agreeing to this interview! First, can you tell us why you decided to tackle information overload and team productivity?</strong></p>



<p>In today’s digital era, the sheer volume of information we encounter necessitates efficient knowledge transfer within and between teams to sustain productivity and drive innovation. The challenge of excessive time consumption during cross-team knowledge transfer emerges as a critical issue, as inefficiencies and unnecessary delays can impede progress and growth.</p>



<p>Consider a common scenario: a product manager needs specific insights from the engineering team. Each inquiry requires an engineer to halt their work to extract information, possibly already documented within the company’s resources. This situation is far from unique; it illustrates the broader issue of time spent on redundant inquiries, locating subject matter experts, navigating poorly maintained documentation, and untangling indirect communication.</p>



<p>These are not rare occurrences; they are part of the daily workflow, cumulatively resulting in significant opportunity costs. Consequently, projects advance more sluggishly, engineers forfeit precious development time, product managers allocate more time to information gathering than to innovation, and sales teams divert time from customer engagement to navigating internal communications.</p>



<p>This challenge is further compounded by the preference of different teams for various tools, resulting in information being stored across multiple locations. And the complexity of this challenge is magnified by the continuous growth of information. As information proliferates, the hurdles in knowledge transfer we face today are merely the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>Addressing these challenges requires strategic interventions for enhanced knowledge management and transfer. Implementing a culture of knowledge sharing, improving documentation practices, and leveraging technology to facilitate seamless information exchange are pivotal steps toward mitigating the time wasted in cross-team knowledge transfers. Such measures not only boost productivity but also cultivate an environment conducive to innovation.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s what inspired you to create Beloga.</strong></p>



<p>In the quest to reshape the landscape of knowledge management and productivity, the inception of Beloga was sparked by a blend of personal challenges and a profound vision for the future.</p>



<p>At its core, Beloga was born out of a necessity to bridge the gap in information accessibility and streamline the workflow across different roles within a team. Its co-founders, driven by their experiences and insights, embarked on a journey to create a platform that not only addresses these challenges but also fosters a culture of shared knowledge and innovation.</p>



<p>The origin story of Beloga is deeply rooted in the personal experiences of its co-founders. Wilson Ler, as an engineering manager and full-stack engineer at a search as a service startup, encountered firsthand the inefficiencies and frustrations that arise from disjointed knowledge management tools. He noted the significant time and productivity lost to context switching and the struggle to maintain a cohesive flow of information across various platforms preferred by different teams. This challenge was not unique to him but a widespread issue that affects productivity and collaboration in many organizations.</p>



<p>Moreover, Jerica brought her passion for productivity and personal development into the mix. Her journey from spreading joy through baking during Covid-19 to raising funds for a noble cause showcased her innate drive to make a difference. This spirit, combined with her obsession with living life efficiently and her experience in building productivity systems, laid the foundational principles that power Beloga.</p>



<p>Beloga’s vision is anchored in the belief that access to shared knowledge is the cornerstone of innovation and productivity. We aim to revolutionize the way individuals and teams research, collaborate, and innovate. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search, to offer a seamless and intuitive experience that cuts through the noise and brings relevant information to the forefront.</p>



<p>In essence, Beloga is not just a response to the challenges faced by its co-founders; it is a testament to their commitment to building a world where information is effortlessly accessible, empowering individuals and teams to achieve their fullest potential. Through Beloga, they envision a future where the speed of thought is matched by the speed of access to knowledge, inspiring a new era of productivity and innovation.</p>



            
            
                                        
            
            


<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"></div>



<p><strong>You use state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation technology. How does that work?</strong></p>



<p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an up and coming technique that addresses the pitfalls of large language models, particularly in the realm of AI hallucinations. It uses a mix of both good information retrieval and generative AI to generate answers which are factually correct. It also has the plus point of surfacing references to sources that were used to generate the answer. That’s huge for AI explainability.</p>



<p>Beloga is built with RAG at its core, with the ability to pull information from multiple sources of information, be it from the web or internal, of different shapes and context sizes and transform them into something that our AI can understand before generating a response out of it.</p>



<p>This works really well for a world where search is democratized and information no longer exists from one singular source, i.e. integrations with multiple apps.</p>



<p><strong>So it’s basically a hyper-personalized knowledge management system!</strong></p>



<p>Yes, exactly! Beloga is not here to replace all of your existing tools, workflows, etc. We would like to be that first point of contact when you need to ask a quick question or craft content in a pinch instead of navigating through a plethora of tools you might have under your belt.</p>



<p>With integrations, our users are able to connect to their existing apps and company knowledge bases to draw information from them. With web search, our users are able to search quickly for information on the web and transform them into whatever they wish by prompt before saving them. With notes, our users are able to accumulate their research and information directly on Beloga before repurposing it again in the future through our AI.</p>



<p>With all of them combined, our users are able to make certain connections between two or more streams of information, such as from the internet and Google Docs for example.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Beloga – Featured Tool Image 2" class="wp-image-15088" height="660" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beloga-image-2-e1711617028697-1024x660.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>That sounds amazing. Can you describe some typical use cases?</strong></p>



<p>You can craft an email for a customer to announce new releases in a software product by pulling information from various product management apps and documentation, or create a guide or recommended steps on the spot during a technical production issue by having Beloga pull information from various runbooks and company documentation.</p>



<p>A user could write a marketing post against a competitor by pulling information about the competitor from the web and information about the product from internal company documentation to do a comparison, or craft a sales pitch for prospective customers from internal company documentation without the need for wading through an overload of technical details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or they could pull answers quickly as a new hire from internal company tools and documentation without having to go through a senior staff member. The possibilities are endless.</p>



<p><strong>Now, let’s say someone wants to generate new ideas for an article, how would they go about that using Beloga?</strong></p>



<p>If you already have a company knowledge base, such as Google Drive, Slab or One Drive, start by integrating that into Beloga and granting access to files or folders. If you have any additional notes as you’re researching along the way, you can also create notes on Beloga directly.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gathered your resources, simply toggle “web”, “notes” and your various integrations and craft a prompt to compare between your company’s features and your target competitor’s. Beloga will then generate a response based on your prompt. You can then share this response with a teammate or save it to your inbox to read it later.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, how do you use Beloga?</strong></p>



<p>We use Beloga on a day-to-day basis to streamline information flow between the two co-founders. For instance, Beloga helps us keep tabs on Beloga’s changelogs and quickly ingest details in our shared Google Drive.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for Beloga?</strong></p>



<p>We want to focus on building more integrations and potentially open an app marketplace. An OS should have a decent number of third party app inputs and outputs. We want to improve Beloga’s user experience and expand to an entire organization.</p>



<p>Ultimately, our goal is to streamline information flow between all members of an organization irregardless of role. We aim to empower folks with the ability to work at the speed of thought. We’re building a world where shared knowledge empowers people and inspires innovation.</p>

<title>Intentional Curiosity: Get your Brain to Focus on What Matters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 注意力、好奇心、皮层、干预、关注<br />
<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了如何理解有意识的好奇心和注意力的神经科学。注意力领域涵盖了内部和外部所有信息，不同的大脑区域管理注意力，从而影响我们的集中和分心。有意识的好奇心是将注意力有意识地引向重要刺激的能力。通过消除明显的干扰、增加注意力负荷、监控思绪、让思绪漫游和增强好奇心等策略，可以有效管理注意力和加强集中力。 <div>
<p>Keeping a focused mind is hard. Imagine you’re working on an important report due tomorrow. As you start writing, your phone lights up with a text from a friend. Your natural curiosity makes you wonder what the message says. Do you give in and check your phone, or do you stay focused on the report?</p>



<p>Every day, thousands of choices like these happen inside your brain. It’s a constant battle between your primal need to know what’s going on around you and your desire to create great work.</p>



<p>While curiosity and focus may seem like opposing drives, they’re actually deeply intertwined. By understanding the neuroscience of attention you can learn to intentionally direct and sustain your curiosity to achieve your ambitions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Science of Intentional Curiosity</strong></h2>



<p>To understand intentional curiosity, we first need to understand the concept of the attentional field. Your attentional field is the combination of everything inside you—thoughts, emotions, physical sensations—and everything outside you, including what you see and hear. It encompasses all the information competing for your brain’s limited attentional resources.</p>



<p>When you’re working on something and receive a notification, two parts of the brain are involved in managing your attention within this field. The prefrontal cortex, directly behind the forehead, is activated when you start concentrating. The parietal cortex, behind the ear, is activated by distracting events.</p>



<p>Research <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346464/">shows</a> these two regions process information differently. The prefrontal cortex emits slower frequency pulses of electricity, which are associated with focused attention and goal-directed behavior. In contrast, the parietal cortex emits faster frequency pulses, enabling quick responses to unexpected stimuli and automatic processing of information.</p>



<p>Long ago, you would have used your prefrontal cortex when working on a tool or building a shelter, but your parietal cortex would have been instantly activated if you heard a strange noise or were attacked by a wild animal. Thus, the parietal cortex is originally a survival tool, ensuring that we can switch our attention to more pressing matters if something urgent happens.</p>



<p>In today’s world, the sources of distractions are constant, and less likely to be critical to our survival. We get interrupted by a never-ending flow of competing cues and information, and it becomes harder to sustain our attention for longer periods of time.</p>



<p>Intentional curiosity is the ability to direct your attention towards information inside or outside of you in a deliberate way. Researchers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620301376">argue</a> that “curiosity addresses the challenge that deliberating about how to allocate attention relies on, and therefore draws down, the same serial information-processing faculties that one is seeking to allocate.”</p>



<p>In other words, curiosity helps us direct our limited attentional resources to the most important stimuli within our attentional field.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adventures in the Attentional Field</strong></h2>



<p>Navigating your attentional field can be challenging, with countless stimuli competing for your limited cognitive resources. Distractions, both internal and external, can easily pull your focus away from the tasks that matter most. However, by cultivating intentional curiosity, you can effectively manage these distractions and strengthen your ability to focus.</p>



<p><strong>1. Remove obvious distractions.</strong> Put your phone away. And by away, I mean in another room. If you work in an open space, put your headphones on to dissuade people from talking to you. And if you’re tempted to check social media on your laptop, install an app that will prevent you from accessing them for a set amount of time.</p>



<p><strong>2. Increase your attentional load.</strong> The Load Theory of Attention <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19327760">posits</a> that because attention is a limited resource, filling all the additional “slots” in your mind may leave no room for other distractions. This is why some people work better when having a bit of background noise or listening to music while in focused mode. Experiment with adding deliberate distractors so your curiosity doesn’t get derailed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Intentional Curiosity and Attentional Load" class="wp-image-15084" height="1648" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/attentional-load-illustration.png" width="2938" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>3. Monitor your mind.</strong> However intentional you are, you will get interrupted by internal or external distractions at one point or another. When faced with a distraction, be curious about why it’s pulling your attention. Is it truly important, or just a fleeting impulse? By evaluating the nature of the distraction, you can more easily redirect your curiosity back to your main task, or identify <a href="https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-attractors">curiosity attractors</a> you might want to explore further at a later point.</p>



<p><strong>4. Make space for mind wandering.</strong> While studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760023/">suggest</a> that letting your mind wander too often can have a negative impact on overall performance in your daily life, scientists have<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5810/393"> found</a> that closing your laptop and daydreaming for a few minutes has a positive impact on cognition. See where your mind wants to go when you let it follow its curiosity. You can even take some notes afterwards to record any interesting thoughts.</p>



<p><strong>5. Strengthen your curiosity.</strong> Make it a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-matrix">habit to be curious</a> about everything in your life—your inner landscape, external events, new interests, and the people around you. By drawing connections between all these areas of your life, you’ll notice that what may seem like a distraction on the surface can be the seed of a project.</p>



<p>Intentional curiosity is not about never losing your focus—which would be unrealistic—but about monitoring your attention and using simple strategies to bring it back to the task at hand when you get distracted, while keeping track of recurring sources of curiosity so you can explore them further in a deliberate way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Slow Productivity</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="Slow Productivity – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-15071" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-march-2024-1-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>In his latest book, Cal Newport challenges the modern notion of productivity, arguing that our current approach often leads to burnout and a lower quality of work. Drawing on the habits and mindsets of historical luminaries such as Galileo, Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, and Georgia O&#8217;Keefe, Newport presents a compelling case for a more sustainable and fulfilling way of working. With a blend of cultural criticism and practical advice, he guides readers through the process of rethinking their approach to productivity, offering strategies for managing workload, embracing seasonal variation, and emphasizing long-term quality over short-term output. For anyone feeling overwhelmed by the demands of modern work, <em>Slow Productivity</em> provides a refreshing and much-needed perspective on how to pursue meaningful accomplishment without sacrificing well-being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Menopause Brain</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="The Menopause Brain – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-15072" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-march-2024-2-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>Menopause is affecting half of the population, and yet, very few books have been written about its impact on the brain and how to manage those symptoms. In <em>The Menopause Brain</em>, Dr. Lisa Mosconi sheds light on the often-misunderstood impact of menopause on women’s cognitive health. As a renowned neuroscientist and brain health expert, Dr. Mosconi explains how the hormonal changes associated with menopause, particularly the decline of estrogen, can affect not only physical symptoms but also mood, memory, and overall brain function. Through her comprehensive overview, which includes the latest research on hormone replacement therapies, lifestyle modifications, and self-care practices, Dr. Mosconi provides women with the tools they need to navigate this transformative period successfully. Perhaps most importantly, she challenges the notion that menopause marks the end of vitality, instead reframing it as a transition to a new phase of life, one in which a woman’s brain can emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultures of Growth</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="Cultures of Growth – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-15073" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-march-2024-3-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>Social psychologist Mary Murphy expands upon Carol Dweck’s groundbreaking concept of growth mindset, demonstrating how it can be applied not just to individuals, but to entire organizations and teams. Through a decade of research, Murphy reveals that cultivating a growth mindset culture can lead to deeper learning, increased collaboration, and greater innovation within any group, while also fostering trust and inclusivity. <em>Cultures of Growth</em> features compelling case studies from diverse fields, including retail, technology, wine-making, and education, illustrating how a culture of growth can transform organizations and help individuals reach their full potential. Murphy provides practical guidance for creating and sustaining a growth mindset culture, regardless of one&#8217;s role within an organization. The book offers a refreshing perspective on success, showing that it can be achieved by people from all backgrounds and levels when the right mindset is nurtured. It’s a must-read for anyone seeking to create environments where individuals and teams can thrive and reach their highest potential together.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Self</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="The Self – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-15074" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-march-2024-4-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>In the latest <em>Very Short Introduction</em> from Oxford University Press, Marya Schechtman delves into the perplexing and often elusive concept of the self. Drawing from diverse fields such as philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology, Schechtman explores the fundamental questions surrounding the nature of the self. Is it an object? If so, what kind? Can the self be separated from the body, or can multiple selves exist within a single individual? The book examines the paradoxical nature of the self – the idea that we are inextricably tied to our own identity, yet we can change, lose, and find ourselves throughout our lives. Schechtman also investigates the role of the environment and social interactions in shaping and maintaining the self. Despite or maybe thanks to its concise format, <em>The Self</em> offers a thought-provoking and multifaceted exploration of one of the most intriguing aspects of human existence. It will be an enjoyable and quick read for anyone seeking to better understand the complex and ever-evolving concept of the self.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Little Treatments, Big Effects</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="Little Treatments, Big Effects – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-15075" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-march-2024-5-683x1024.jpg" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>This book by Jessica Schleider offers a groundbreaking solution to the global mental health crisis, addressing the startling fact that more than half of adults and three-quarters of young people worldwide lack access to adequate psychological support. The book introduces the concept of single-session interventions, a novel approach to mental healthcare that aims to make treatment more accessible and effective. By combining the latest psychological research, personal narratives of lived experiences, and practical self-help exercises, Schleider demonstrates how these brief therapeutic encounters can create meaningful moments in an individual’s recovery journey. The book not only provides a roadmap for those seeking to improve their own mental well-being but also presents a compelling case for systemic change in the way mental healthcare is delivered. <em>Little Treatments, Big Effects</em> was written for anyone who has struggled to access mental health support or is passionate about transforming the mental healthcare system into one that is truly accessible to all.</p>

<p>In our fast-paced world, living a mindful life can seem almost impossible. And yet, we are constantly bombarded with exhortations to improve and suggestions for being our best selves. Should you sacrifice your health for work or sacrifice work for your health?</p>



<p>Fortunately, there’s a way out of this seemingly unsolvable equation. The key is to focus on a holistic approach to well-being, which can be achieved by paying attention to three key pillars: your mental, emotional, and physical health.</p>



<p>When your mental health suffers, your immune system and your ability to regulate your emotions can be affected. Similarly, poor emotional health can have a detrimental effect on your relationships, which can then in turn harm your mental health.</p>



<p>None of these three factors is more important than the other; they are all interconnected just like puzzle pieces that need to be put together to get a complete picture. This is why maintaining your overall well-being is contingent upon what I like to call the Triple Take.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Triple Take – Mental, Physical &amp; Emotional Wellness" class="wp-image-15050" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4-1024x576.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Mental Health: Prioritize Social Connections</h2>



<p>Humans are fundamentally wired for social interactions. Research<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140528102932.htm"> indicates</a> that creating positive social interactions is not just something we naturally need, but is also essential to our well-being. Similar to our innate need for food and shelter, we are built to seek out other people’s company.</p>



<p>People who prioritize social connections tend to adopt healthier lifestyles including regular exercise and balanced diets. Moreover, they<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101215141921.htm"> recover quicker</a> from health challenges due to the help and support they receive from their social networks.</p>



<p>Social interactions also help combat feelings of loneliness, lowers the risk of mental disease, and provides a sense of purpose. Regularly participating in social events not only allows you to meet others who have similar interests but also helps improve your mental health.</p>



<p>Meaningful relationships provide a support system during difficult times and contribute to feelings of happiness and belonging. Knowing that you have people you can rely on during times of need can <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-55019-4_4">help</a> increase your resilience.</p>



<p>For this pillar of well-being, take some time each week to connect with others, whether it’s over a cup of coffee with a colleague or a family visit. It doesn’t necessarily have to be physical interactions. A simple phone call or a video call can also help improve your well-being through social connection</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Emotional Health: Practice Mindfulness</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is a powerful tool for promoting your physical, mental, and emotional health. There are a plethora of techniques to choose from: connecting with your body through breathwork, observing your thoughts through meditation, and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mindfulness practices have been <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200909100214.htm">linked</a> to increased vascular relaxation, which may result in a decrease in blood pressure. Additionally, a University of Wisconsin study <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/02/030204074125.htm">found</a> that mindfulness meditation leads to long-lasting improvements in immune system and brain function. Surprisingly, some researchers <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090609072719.htm">discovered</a> that mindfulness practices like meditation could be an effective behavioral treatment for insomnia.</p>



<p>Another research also<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170501094325.htm"> suggests</a> that even ten minutes of meditation each day can help prevent your mind from wandering unnecessarily, especially if you are prone to anxious thoughts.</p>



<p>By engaging in mindfulness activities, you develop a deeper understanding and acceptance of your emotions, boosting your emotional resilience, and leaving you with greater inner peace. Keeping a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary">journal</a>, in particular, helps you develop a deep relationship with yourself.</p>



<p>For this pillar, take a few minutes to just be in the present moment – whether it’s in the morning or evening, or even throughout your day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Physical Health: Engage in Regular Exercise</h2>



<p>Exercise is essential as part of a holistic approach to achieving the best possible wellness. Consistent exercise has <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180125110030.htm">many</a> physical benefits such as weight management, improved heart health, and increased energy levels. Regular exercise also <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111122143354.htm">promotes</a> your sleep quality and reduces your risk of certain cancers.</p>



<p>Frequent physical activity is known to boost your mood and help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. It also positively impacts your decision-making and concentration. In fact, research<a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203"> shows</a> that exercise may even be more effective than medicine to manage your mental health.</p>



<p>For this pillar of well-being, dedicate some time to exercise every week. You don’t have to go to the gym to exercise. Even a simple 20-minute walk can help you enjoy the health benefits of exercising.</p>



<p>Although it can be challenging to maintain our well-being with all the pressures of modern life, remember that some simple changes across the three pillars of well-being can have outsized impact on your mental, emotional, and physical health.</p>



<p>Take a few minutes every day to connect with your loved ones, practice mindfulness, and move your body. These seemingly simple acts can have a profound impact on your overall well-being.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to wellness, so <a href="https://nesslabs.com/personal-experiments">experiment</a> to figure out what works best for you. Being intentional about your well-being is already a meaningful investment in yourself.</p>

<title>Rediscovering Ikigai: What We Got Wrong and How to Find Meaning in Life</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/ikigai?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ikigai</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/ikigai?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ikigai</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> ikigai, 日本文化, 健康益处, 利用ikigai, 总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了日本文化中的ikigai概念，即人生的原因和目的，强调了ikigai对心理和身体健康的积极影响。文章提到ikigai可以减轻焦虑、有助于心脏健康、增强自我掌控能力、提高应对逆境的能力、延长寿命等。同时还提到了如何利用ikigai，强调不要追求唯一的激情，要持续学习、不追求金钱和努力拯救世界，而是专注于每天生活中的乐趣和意义，通过日常体验寻找快乐。 <div>
<p>I lived in Japan for seven months when I was younger. For all of the challenges I faced there as a woman and a foreigner, I still learned a lot from Japanese culture.</p>



<p>Because Japan experienced a long period of relative isolation from the outside world — caused by <em>sakoku</em> (literally “closed country”), the isolationist foreign policy of the military government during the Edo period — Japanese people have developed their own unique set of values and beliefs.</p>



<p>One unique Japanese concept is the idea of <em>ikigai</em>, which can be roughly translated to <em>reason for being</em> (or “raison d’être” in my native French)<em> </em>. Each person’s ikigai is personal to them, reflective of their inner self, and creating a mental state in which they feel at ease.</p>



<p>What makes it such a powerful idea in today’s age of constant change and uncertainty is that ikigai doesn’t limit someone’s value in life to career and financial status. In fact, in a survey of 2,000 Japanese people <a href="https://www.crs.or.jp/backno/No636/6362.htm">conducted</a> by Central Research Services, only a third of respondents considered work as their ikigai.</p>



<p>Rather, ikigai is about feeling your life makes a difference in people’s lives — the idea that you can contribute to other people’s lives simply by living a fulfilling life. And this idea can unlock many benefits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Health Benefits of Ikigai</h2>



<p>Because your ikigai is less of a theory and more of a way of living, it can have a profound impact on your mental and physical health.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ikigai reduces anxiety.</strong> Research <a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/gjhs/article/view/18478/12980">shows</a> that the feeling of ikigai contributes to a well-balanced secretion of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, which in turn reduces the feeling of stress.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai is good for your heart.</strong> A seven-year long study with more than 40,000 Japanese adults <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596247">found</a> evidence that people with a low sense of ikigai had a higher overall mortality risk, mostly due to higher cardiovascular disease.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai increases your self-authorship.</strong> Research <a href="https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(09)00479-2/abstract">suggests</a> that people without ikigai have a strong need for approval from others, while those with ikigai tend to perform tasks for their own satisfaction.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai makes you more resilient.</strong> There’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021747419204">evidence</a> that ikigai may help you go through times of hardship more easily, making you feel like it’s worthwhile to continue living. For example, it helped many Japanese people cope <a href="http://www.scirp.org/fileOperation/downLoad.aspx?path=PSYCH20110800005_56761305.pdf&amp;type=journal">during</a> the earthquake that occurred in Japan in March 2011 and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349725406_Health_Benefits_of_Ikigai_A_Review_of_Literature">during</a> the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai helps you live longer.</strong> Another study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19539820">identified</a> ikigai as a positive psychological factor contributing to longevity, with men and women with a sense of ikigai showing decreased risks of mortality from all causes.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, there’s quite a bit of research suggesting that a sense of ikigai will contribute to your overall well-being. So, how can you leverage the power of ikigai?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leverage the Power of Ikigai</h2>



<p>The concept of ikigai has often been misunderstood in the Western world largely due to the popularity of the below Venn diagram:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Ikigai Venn Diagram 1" class="wp-image-15044" height="574" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ikigai-venn-diagram-1-1024x574.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>This diagram was created in 2011 by astrologer Andres Zuzunaga, who designed it to help people find their purpose in life, and was then adapted by blogger Marc Winn, who replaced the word “purpose” with “ikigai” (you can read the whole story <a href="https://ikigaitribe.com/ikigai/ikigai-misunderstood/">here</a>).</p>



<p>However, the concept of ikigai is not about finding the intersection of what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for. It’s just about finding pleasure in life and being happy to get up in the morning.</p>



<p>“Japanese people don’t view ikigai as a lofty goal, a destination, or something to achieve,” explains Nicholas Kemp, author of the book <em>Ikigai-Kan</em>. Similarly, in The Little Book of Ikigai, Ken Mogi wrote: “Japanese do not need grandiose motivational frameworks to keep going, but rely more on the little rituals in their daily routines.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Ikigai Venn Diagram 2" class="wp-image-15045" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ikigai-venn-diagram-2-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>Your ikigai can be found in small daily rituals, side projects, and deep conversations. It can be found in moments of silence and idleness, or in moments of creative flow. To find your ikigai, forget about the westernized version and instead follow these principles:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stop seeking your One True Passion.</strong> Many of us think that finding our passion will magically give our life a purpose. Instead, find meaning in your daily experiences and interactions. Explore the world around and inside you. Learn something new everyday, including about yourself. Play with uncertainty instead of chasing the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/the-paradox-of-goals">next milestone</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Embrace lifelong learning.</strong> The concept of ikigai never mentions being good at what you do. There is joy in being a beginner all over again, learning through mistakes, and growing outside of your comfort zone. Don’t try to be the expert in the room. Keep <a href="https://nesslabs.com/generative-questions">asking questions</a>. Never stop learning.</li>



<li><strong>Let go of lofty financial goals.</strong> Ikigai also doesn’t have anything to do with money. Of course, we all need enough money to live a comfortable life, and money can help explore projects and ideas that bring you pleasure in life, but beyond the point of comfort, financial success should be seen as a potential byproduct of living a meaningful life.</li>



<li><strong>Don’t try to save the world.</strong> Instead, focus on the positive impact you can have on your friends, family, colleagues, and community. Ask yourself how you can connect with people in meaningful ways and which changes you want to bring to life. This is how we save the world — when everyone contributes at their own human scale.</li>
</ol>



<p>As psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%94%9F%E3%81%8D%E3%81%8C%E3%81%84%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6-%E7%A5%9E%E8%B0%B7%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%B5%E5%AD%90%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3-%E7%A5%9E%E8%B0%B7-%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%B5%E5%AD%90/dp/4622081814">puts it</a>, ikigai is closer in meaning to the “power necessary to live in this world” or the “happiness to be alive”, which unfortunately gets translated to a life “worth living” in English, when the original concept doesn’t ascribe value nor measures of meaning in our lives.</p>



<p>Instead of pursuing linear goals, optimize for wanting to wake up in the morning. Live a life of curiosity and connection. Trust that success will be a byproduct of the meaning you find in daily experiences.</p>

<div> AI, Brainstory, Lilly Chen, productivity, privacy
<br />
<br />
总结: Lilly Chen 是 Brainstory 的创始人，这是一个基于苏格拉底质疑方法的 AI 助手，旨在帮助人们更好地思考和提高工作效率。Brainstory能帮助人们在思考过程中找到自己的瞬间灵感，而不是替他们思考。用户可以通过Brainstory进行目标设定、项目规划，提升整体生产力，还可以用于日常意图记录、团队决策会议等。Brainstory注重隐私保护，不使用客户数据进行模型训练。通过启用上下文共享功能，Brainstory将使体验更加神奇。企业将参与Brainstory，进一步提高用户持续参与度和满意度。 <div>
<a class="featured-tool-label" href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">FEATURED TOOL</a>



<p>Welcome to this edition of our tools for thought series, where we interview founders on a mission to help us think better and work smarter. Lilly Chen is the founder of <a href="https://www.brainstory.ai/">Brainstory</a>, an AI-powered “think out-loud” app based on the Socratic method of questioning. Brainstory is designed to help people find their moments of brilliance without the slump.</p>



<p>In this interview, we talked about how to use AI for better thinking, how to practice open-mindedness and curious questioning, how to make context sharing efficient, asynchronous, and equal, how to use AI-based open-ended journaling to improve communication and focus, and much more. Enjoy the read!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Brainstory – Image 1" class="wp-image-15020" height="611" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1024x611.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Hi Lilly, thanks for agreeing to this interview! A lot of the conversation around AI tools is centered on generative AI. But you thought of another use case.</strong></p>



<p>I joined the Board of Trustees at Colorado College while I was working as a machine learning engineer. When ChatGPT was released, the vast majority of our students were using it and professors were unsure what to do.</p>



<p>As a technologist, I believe AI is here to stay. As an educator, I believe we have to teach the next generation how to use AI <em>well</em>. I felt like a lot of students were using AI to think <em>for </em>them, but that they still had the “itch” to problem-solve for themselves. So I wanted to create an AI tool that helped people do their best thinking, without thinking for them.</p>



<p><strong>Is that what inspired you to create Brainstory?</strong></p>



<p>The philosophy behind Brainstory was inspired by the head monk at a monastery where I lived as a teenager. Long story short, while I was living at the monastery, the head monk asked me a series of questions about whether I wanted to be there or not. It was the most comforting, reflective experience I’ve ever had.</p>



<p>Through his open-mindedness and curious questioning, I realized that I wanted to attend college. People (and various AI tools) are so prone to <em>giving</em> advice instead of listening. There’s a lot of cheesy sayings about the answer being within us all along, but it’s totally true.</p>



<p><strong>So, how does it work?</strong></p>



<p>You can think of Brainstory like the monk. A non-judgmental, curious listener. You have to speak out loud because it helps you organize and clarify your thoughts. Brainstory will listen and ask follow-up questions. Through this process, you’ll discover answers you didn’t know you had.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Brainstory – Image 2" class="wp-image-15021" height="666" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1-1024x666.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>How can people use Brainstory to improve their productivity?</strong></p>



<p>People can do their goal-setting, project planning, and improving their overall productivity with Brainstory. Here’s an example: say that you have a pitch for what you want to write about. You can talk it out with Brainstory and use it to clarify details and topics you want to address.</p>



<p>Your colleagues can then take your Brainstory and give feedback on your idea in the app, and you can get an overall view of everyone’s thoughts, and have more clarity both on what you want to write, and what you should change, faster than ever. This workflow can work for classrooms, for groups of friends, or even just for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>I imagine this would be great for journaling as well.</strong></p>



<p>One feature of Brainstory is called “Daily Intent”. Once a day, you can complete a Brainstory focused on your day, whether it’s reflective or planning. You’ll have the option to complete a log of behaviors as well. It’s a mix of open-ended journaling with tracking for people who want to see how Brainstory can fundamentally improve their communication and focus.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Brainstory – Image 3" class="wp-image-15022" height="562" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2-1024x562.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Sometimes it’s better to think together. What about bringing others on board to brainstorm together?</strong></p>



<p>One of my favorite ways to use Brainstory is for decision-making meetings. When a decision needs to be made, the primary reason you call a meeting is so that all the relevant people can share their context, and open-ended discussion can bring out new ideas. Brainstory makes context sharing efficient, asynchronous, and above all, equal. Everyone can talk and be heard. The resulting group Brainstory serves as a source of truth for a decision to be made.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Brainstory – Image 4" class="wp-image-15023" height="450" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3-1024x450.png" width="1024" /></figure>



<p><strong>A big concern with such AI-powered thinking tools is privacy and how our information can be used for training models. How does Brainstory address this concern?</strong></p>



<p>We don’t use any of our customer’s sessions for training data. We understand that a lot of people are using it for very personal purposes or for work. Even internally, we cannot read the logs of your conversations. So you don’t have to worry about an AI or a human knowing what you talked about. We have a Privacy Policy as well that goes into more detail.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of people use Brainstory?</strong></p>



<p>People who feel like their best ideas are always on the tip of their tongue. That can be students who know what they want to write, but not how to start. This could be the developer who can feel the solution to their bug being just <em>moments </em>away. Teams who feel like their creativity can shine with just <em>one</em> more meeting– all of these people are people who use Brainstory to have their best thoughts.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Brainstory Animation" class="wp-image-15029" height="580" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/brainstory-animation-1024x580.gif" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>What about you, how do you use Brainstory?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I use Brainstory to make progress on my goals, like health and tennis. Long story short, I had a life altering concussion about a year ago and my overall health fell off the wayside. I needed to change my diet, ideally lose a lot of weight, and find physical activity that worked for my lifestyle. Using Brainstory, I’m able to troubleshoot my struggles, essentially acting as my own personal trainer, coach, nutritionist, and therapist.</p>



<p>Professionally, I use Brainstory to pitch product features, plan team meetings, to send out company memos, and to get feedback from investors.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for Brainstory?</strong></p>



<p>We’re looking to make the Brainstory experience even more magical by enabling context sharing. This means that Brainstory will be able to reference all of your past conversations to better help you pattern match and compare your progression over time. Our mission is to help people think smarter, not offload their thinking onto AI. If you have a magic idea for us, please share it in our <a href="http://brainstory.ai/discord">community Discord</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Lilly! Where can people learn more about Brainstory?</strong></p>



<p>You can sign up at <a href="https://www.brainstory.ai/">brainstory.ai</a> and where we also have a <a href="https://www.brainstory.ai/glossary">glossary</a> of terms we discussed in this interview.

<title>The Curiosity Conflict: Why we Struggle to Shift from Exploration to Exploitation</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-conflict?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=curiosity-conflict</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-conflict?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=curiosity-conflict</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> curiosity, conflict, dopamine, strategies, exploration
<br />
Curiosity can fuel creativity but also hinder productivity due to the conflict between exploration and exploitation. The brain's reward system, influenced by dopamine, plays a role in this struggle. Strategies to resolve this conflict include keeping a curiosity inbox, allocating time for execution, partnering with a Doing Buddy, practicing metacognition, and embracing the joy of missing out. These techniques help balance curiosity and focus, allowing individuals to turn their ideas into reality effectively.
<br /><br />总结: Curiosity can drive creativity but may lead to productivity challenges. The brain's reward system and dopamine influence the balance between exploration and execution. Strategies such as maintaining a curiosity inbox, allocating time for execution, partnering with a Doing Buddy, practicing metacognition, and embracing the joy of missing out help individuals navigate the curiosity conflict and bring their ideas to fruition. <div>
<p>Do you always find yourself excited by new ideas and projects? Being naturally curious, you enjoy learning, discovering new insights, and developing your skills. Your curiosity is one of your greatest strengths, driving you to explore and grow.</p>



<p>But that same curiosity can be a double-edged sword. With so many ideas competing for your attention, it can be hard to decide which one to pursue. You might experience choice paralysis, unable to commit to a single project because you don’t want to miss out on the others. As a result, you may find yourself starting many projects but only finishing a few.</p>



<p>This is what I call the “curiosity conflict”: the phenomenon where your greatest asset for creativity—your curiosity—can get in the way of your productivity. In short:</p>



<ul>
<li>High curiosity is what allows you to generate lots of creative ideas—it makes it easy to ideate.</li>



<li>High curiosity is also what makes it difficult to focus on one idea—it can make it hard to execute.</li>
</ul>



<p>The curiosity conflict can fuel a frustrating cycle that leaves you feeling stuck despite your wealth of ideas and your love for learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Curiosity’s Double-Edged Sword</h2>



<p>Curiosity is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635443/">connected</a> to the brain’s reward system, which is heavily influenced by dopamine. When you encounter novel stimuli, your brain releases dopamine, which motivates you to learn more. This dopaminergic response is thought to be a key factor in the drive for exploration.</p>



<p>Research has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314008046">shown</a> that people with higher levels of curiosity tend to have greater activity in brain regions associated with reward processing. This heightened sensitivity to potential rewards may explain why highly curious people are more likely to engage in exploratory behavior and seek out new experiences.</p>



<p>But this same reward-seeking mechanism can also contribute to difficulty focusing on a single idea or project. When presented with multiple new ideas or projects, the curious brain may <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524091/">experience</a> a surge of dopamine in response to each potential reward. This can create a sense of excitement and a desire to explore all the possibilities, making it challenging to commit to just one path.</p>



<p>In essence, the curiosity conflict arises from the brain’s struggle to shift from exploration to exploitation: the dopaminergic reward system that fuels curiosity can make it difficult to transition from the excitement of exploration to the more focused work of exploitation. How can you make that shift easier?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resolving the Curiosity Conflict</h2>



<p>The constant pull between the excitement of new ideas and the need to focus on one project is a natural part of the creative process. Fortunately, there are strategies you can use to navigate the curiosity conflict and make the most of your curious mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/curiosity-conflict-management.png"><img alt="Five Ways to Manage the Curiosity Conflict: Curiosity Inbox, Time Shielding, Doing Buddy, Metacognition, Joy of Missing Out" class="wp-image-15012" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/curiosity-conflict-management-1024x576.png" width="1024" /></a></figure>



<p><strong>1. Keep a curiosity inbox.</strong> Whenever you get a new idea, write it down in a specific note or on a dedicated page in your notebook. Then, each time the idea pops back into your mind, give it a mark or increase its rating. Over time, you’ll develop a ranked list of ideas based on your long-term interests. This strategy allows you to continue exploring new ideas while also identifying which ones have the most potential for further development, which is a great way to manage your ideas without stifling your curiosity.</p>



<p><strong>2. Shield time to shift from exploration to exploitation.</strong> Choose one idea from your curiosity inbox and spend an hour drafting an execution plan. Break down the idea into smaller, actionable steps and consider what resources you’ll need—time, money, support—to bring it to life. Feel free to use an <a href="https://nesslabs.com/think-with-ai">AI companion</a> to clarify your execution plan. By explicitly <a href="https://nesslabs.com/timeshielding-time-management">carving out time</a> for envisioning the shift, you’ll make it easier to move from broad exploration to focused exploitation.</p>



<p><strong>3. Partner with a Doing Buddy.</strong> Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the early days of Apple are a famous example of a thinking/doing duo. Jobs was the visionary thinker, while Wozniak was the engineering wizard who turned those ideas into reality. Similarly, identify someone in your network who has a knack for getting things done and partner with them to bring your idea to life.</p>



<p><strong>4. Practice metacognition.</strong> Make sure to regularly reflect on your progress so you can balance exploration and exploitation. Think about ways you can focus your curiosity when executing on an idea. You can use the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next">Plus Minus Next</a> method to conduct a weekly review and assess what’s working, what could be better, and where you want to direct your efforts next. The “next” column will help you recognize when you’re getting pulled in too many directions and make a conscious choice to focus.</p>



<p><strong>5. Embrace the joy of missing out.</strong> Your curiosity can make you more acutely aware of the potential benefits you’re foregoing by committing to one project over others. This heightened sensitivity to missed opportunities can fuel indecision and make it harder to focus on a single idea. But having many interests is a strength, not a weakness. Remind yourself that there will always be new ideas to explore. Trust that <a href="https://nesslabs.com/jomo">you’re not missing out</a> by focusing on your current project.</p>



<p>Remember, the curiosity conflict is a natural part of the creative process. By implementing these strategies—keeping a curiosity inbox, shielding time to shift from exploration to exploitation, and finding a Doing Buddy—you can leverage your curiosity while also making tangible progress on your ideas, and you’ll feel better equipped to turn your ideas into reality.</p>

<title>How to Build a Better Writing Habit</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/writing-habit-loop?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=writing-habit-loop</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/writing-habit-loop?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=writing-habit-loop</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2019 I made a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact">pact</a> to write a hundred articles in a hundred workdays. Since then, I have written and published one new article almost every week, and I have kept with this cadence while running a business and studying for my PhD. This is my longest running <a href="https://nesslabs.com/personal-experiments">personal experiment</a>.</p>



<p>Over the years, a few people have reached out asking how I manage to write consistently without compromising on quality, so I wanted to share some strategies to build a better writing habit. Hopefully this may inspire more people to create content they’ve been meaning to put into the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Writing that matters</h2>



<p>All the productivity systems in the universe won’t matter if you don’t care about your writing practice. You can think of this as your <a href="https://nesslabs.com/writing-thinking-tool">writing ikigai</a>.</p>



<p>In my case, I want to help people live more fulfilling lives, and I believe this can be achieved by exploring our ambitions without sacrificing our mental health. Writing, to me, is a way to get these ideas out there and to build a sustainable business while doing so.</p>



<p>Every time I publish a new article, new people discover my work, sign up to the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>, and become a part of my community. Most may remain passive readers, others may contribute their own ideas, and some may even become friends or collaborators.</p>



<p>While each article I write is just that⁠ — an article ⁠— every time I hit publish, this simple action compounds to build a life that makes me want to get up in the morning.</p>



<p>Taking your writing practice seriously doesn’t mean you need a long-term goal. Rather, it means your writing needs to be aligned with the life you want to live — it needs to <em>feel alive to you</em>.</p>



<p>So before you can build a better writing habit, you need to ask yourself how you want writing to contribute to your life. Do you want to write to clarify your thoughts, to connect with others, to support a business you care about?</p>



<p>Take a few minutes to think about this question, and write it down in your journal or your note-taking app. Next, I’ll share the second important mindset shift you need to make to build a better writing habit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Killing your inner critic</h2>



<p>Many people struggle to create content on a consistent basis because they have an idealized view of what the output should look like. While it is important to put good content out and into the world, you can only improve through the process of creating.</p>



<p>I previously wrote about the importance of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/brainstorming">quantity over quality</a> in the creative process. Research <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479710/">shows</a> that the more you create, the more creative you become.</p>



<p>This means that instead of working for two weeks on one piece, you’d ideally first commit to publishing several pieces following a consistent schedule. Depending on how much time you have, this could be daily, bi-weekly, or weekly.</p>



<p><strong>1. Commit to a schedule.</strong> Make a simple pact in this format:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>I will write &#91;number of articles] in &#91;time scale].</code></pre>



<p>The most important aspect is to stick to your pact as closely as possible so you can collect enough data to know what works and what doesn’t. So take your other commitments into account and go for a realistic schedule.</p>



<p><strong>2. Tell someone about your pact.</strong> The best way I have found to achieve this level of consistency is to <a href="https://nesslabs.com/learning-in-public">commit to it publicly</a>. It doesn’t have to be very public! Just telling a friend or a colleague you’re making a pact to write regularly is a great start. You could even become accountability partners.</p>



<p><strong>3. Make time to write.</strong> The last step is <a href="https://nesslabs.com/timeshielding-time-management">shielding time</a> in your calendar for reading, research, and writing. It could be a couple of hours on Sunday evening, or shorter sessions throughout the week. This way, you won’t let your inner critic decide when you’re ready to write (the answer would be: <em>never</em>).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The writing habit loop</h2>



<p>Now that you’ve made a pact, let’s break it down into smaller tasks. I call this the writing habit loop. Similar to any experiment, it consists in committing to an action, performing it, reflecting on the result, and implementing any changes during the next cycle.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/writing-habit-loop-banner-updated.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-15001" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/writing-habit-loop-banner-updated-1024x576.png" width="1024" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Writing Habit Loop</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Here is how I use the writing habit loop to write a new article every week:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Generate ideas.</strong> Jot down ideas whenever they pop up. I often have ideas when chatting with people and I often interrupt them with “wait a second, that was super interesting, let me just make a note of it.” And no, people don’t find it rude, quite the contrary! It’s quite flattering when someone thinks that what you just said is worth writing down.</li>



<li><strong>Sit down and set a timer.</strong> Because you have shielded your writing time, you just need to sit down and open a new document. All of the mental energy you would have used to figure out when and where to write can be saved for the actual writing. You may also have heard about Parkinson’s law, the adage that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” Giving yourself a time limit can help you stay focused.</li>



<li><strong>Choose an idea.</strong> Go through your list of ideas and pick a topic that feels alive and aligned with your current aspirations.</li>



<li><strong>Create an outline.</strong> Start by writing a few bullet points based on your initial thoughts about the topic. Nobody will see this, so, again, kill your inner critic and just let your imagination flow. Ideally, you want to have 3-5 bullet points touching on different aspects of the idea. These bullet points could be as simple as: What is it about? What’s good about it? What could be better?</li>



<li><strong>(optional) Conduct extra research.</strong> Depending on the topic, you may be able to just write about the topic without any further help, but often it’s useful to look it up. This is great for your readers, since you can link to further resources. But, importantly, it’s great for you: you’ll get to learn new things in the process of writing.</li>



<li><strong>Re-read it once.</strong> Yes, only once. I usually re-read my articles in preview mode on my website, because seeing it with a different font and format makes it look brand new to my eyes. Just give it one good, focused re-reading, but do not spend too much time trying to make it perfect. </li>



<li><strong>Hit publish.</strong> Don’t look back. Bring that baby into the world.</li>



<li><strong>Share it.</strong> Try to get as much feedback as you can. Don’t be shy. Share your article with friends, on social media, or through your mailing list. Take notes whenever you receive feedback, and make sure to implement what makes sense in your subsequent articles.</li>
</ol>



<p>That’s it! You have now turned writing into a habit loop. Keep on showing up and improving through each <a href="https://nesslabs.com/growth-loops">cycle of experimentation</a>. Keep on exploring ideas that feel alive and align with your aspirations.</p>



<p>When you look back in a few months or a few year, you’ll be amazed to see how much your thinking has evolved thanks to your writing habit. And maybe you’ll even make a few friends along the way.<br /></p>

<title>Write notes with complete freedom with Abdullah Atta, founder of Notesnook</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/notesnook-featured-tool?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=notesnook-featured-tool</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<a class="featured-tool-label" href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">FEATURED TOOL</a>



<p>Welcome to this edition of our Tools for Thought series, where we interview founders on a mission to help us think better and work smarter. Abdullah Atta is the founder of <a href="https://notesnook.com/">Notesnook</a>, an open source and end-to-end encrypted note-taking app with cross-device syncing.</p>



<p>Abdullah is obsessed with privacy, promising no spying and no tracking, and has designed many features to ensure your information is only accessible to who you want it to. In this interview, we talked about the value of privacy for everyone, how to balance privacy and convenience, their commitment&nbsp; to radical transparency, the power of a notes-centric approach, and much more. Enjoy the read!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Notesnook Image 1" class="wp-image-14991" height="641" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/notesnook-image-1-1024x641.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Hi Abdullah, thanks for agreeing to this interview! You believe that privacy is for everyone, not just the privileged few. Can you tell us more about your vision?</strong></p>



<p>Thank you for having me and for giving us this opportunity! The very question of how to protect your privacy online is counterproductive to the concept of privacy. Privacy shouldn’t be something you have to worry about every minute of your time online. It should come built-in as a default in every piece of technology you use. That’s what privacy for everyone means.</p>



<p>Sadly, in this day and age, privacy has become a rare commodity. Almost every device nowadays has trackers, installed by the very company that built them, to spy on users and collect their data. We have 50 pages long “privacy policies” that very clearly outline how a company spies on its users and how it collects and sells user data to third parties. In short, caring about your privacy means constant worry, constant bookkeeping, and a lot of anxiety. It’s unfair but true.</p>



<p>I want to change that. Privacy for everyone starts with people never even thinking that someone might steal their data because the software they use makes it technically impossible. That’s how it was before the digital age, and that’s how it should be now. We built walls around our homes not because we had something to hide but because we valued our privacy. I think it’s high time people start building walls around their digital homes. That’s my vision, and that’s why we are building Notesnook.</p>



<p><strong>So privacy is a core value in how you designed Notesnook.</strong></p>



<p>In Notesnook, privacy is <em>not</em> a feature but a default. You don’t have to turn on a toggle or switch some settings to ensure your privacy. It’s built right into the code and benefits every user regardless of their subscription status or their usage pattern. You can think of it like this: privacy is the foundation upon which everything else is built.</p>



<p>One of our core values is to never use privacy as an excuse to compromise on user convenience. A lot of privacy invasive tools out there have an edge due to their ability to process and use user data on their powerful servers. Notesnook does not have this luxury because all your data is encrypted with a key that only you have access to. We cannot read your notes or access them in any way i.e., we have made it technically impossible for anyone to spy on you.</p>



<p>Despite all these limitations we have built a robust note taking app that does everything you are used to, in a way that you are used to. In fact, most of the time, you won’t even realize that your data is encrypted, or that the app is going the extra mile to protect your privacy.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Notesnook Image 2" class="wp-image-14992" height="639" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/notesnook-image-2-1024x639.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>Since each feature needs to be developed on the client side (which takes extra time and resources), most privacy-first software suffer a lot when it comes to feature parity. You’d be using one feature on the desktop app but won’t have access to it on the mobile app.</p>



<p>Not with Notesnook. Right from the start, we have had 99% feature parity across platforms allowing you to easily switch between device form factors without worrying about this or that feature being available or not. All of that with the same privacy and security guarantees.</p>



<p><strong>But how can users be sure you’re actually encrypting their data?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we <em>are</em> open source. I have been waiting to say that for so long! Building trust is the single most important thing when it comes to providing a service. Even a non-private service has to take steps in order to build user trust, and that’s why we open sourced Notesnook. There’s just no other way to guarantee users’ privacy without being fully transparent.</p>



<p>If at this very moment you want to be sure that your data is actually being encrypted or not, all you have to do is take a look at the source code. If even that doesn’t satisfy you, we provide a specialized open source tool for this task called <a href="https://vericrypt.notesnook.com/">Vericrypt</a>. <a href="https://vericrypt.notesnook.com/">Vericrypt</a> allows you to take the raw data that is being sent to Notesnook’s servers and decrypt it right in your browser, hence verifying that it really is encrypted.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond being privacy-first, it looks like you have put lots of thought into the overall design of Notesnook.</strong></p>



<p>At the end of the day any tool’s real superpower is how it helps its users be more productive. Notesnook is no exception. We have designed Notesnook to be as simple and obvious as possible. There should be no hidden surprises, no complex concepts for you to learn.</p>



<p>Notesnook has a really feature-rich editor to help you make todo lists, do your finances with tables, add images (that automatically get stored privately), attach and read PDFs, and embed videos. We also allow you to use Markdown shortcuts to quickly format your notes, dedicated RTL support, and a special block for adding math and chemistry formulas.</p>



<p>To add an extra layer of security and control over your notes, Notesnook has a built-in encrypted vault to help you store secrets, passwords, and other sensitive information without having to worry about prying eyes. Vault is not just a password over your notes – it also double encrypts your notes so no one can steal them.</p>



<p>One of our main goals with Notesnook is to find a nice balance between features and simplicity. We don’t want to build a bloated mess that breaks apart at every second, and is slow and frustrating to use. That is why performance is one of our primary focuses. If you use Notesnook, you’ll immediately notice just how fast it is. That is not by accident.</p>



<p>There are so many things in Notesnook like taking notes from the notification drawer on Android, sharing articles or text directly to Notesnook, clipping web pages, Android Home and iOS widgets etc., that will really enhance your day to day note taking experience.</p>



<p><strong>A big challenge with note-taking apps is that we save things in there but then forget about them. How does Notesnook tackle this challenge?</strong></p>



<p>The main way, of course, is to organize your notes in such a way that you can quickly find them later. For that we provide 3 primary ways: notebooks &amp; topics, tags, and colors. You can also pin important notes so you never lose sight of them, or add reminders to specific notes and be notified later on all your devices. Notesnook’s search is still a little flaky but we are working on that along with filters, saved searches etc.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of people use Notesnook?</strong></p>



<p>We have over 100,000 users from all kinds of professions using Notesnook everyday for their note taking. Developers are using Notesnook to keep track of their projects, build roadmaps, share release notes, and write documentation. I recently heard that <a href="https://nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> has been using Notesnook for publishing their meeting minutes and agenda via Monographs.</p>



<p>A lot of people are using Notesnook for habit tracking, medication reminders, bill reminders, roadmap tracking, grocery lists, reading lists, and writing documentation among other use cases. I think Notesnook is for all kinds of users but your mileage might vary.</p>



<p>We have tried to make Notesnook as simple and as flexible as possible to allow all kinds of use cases. There are still limitations, though. People looking for Notion-like database features and Excel spreadsheets will be disappointed but if they are looking for a tool that is fast, simple, and efficient while protecting their privacy at all costs then Notesnook is the answer.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, how do you use Notesnook?</strong></p>



<p>My primary usage consists of managing Notesnook development so basically all the roadmaps, release notes, blog posts, discussions, and meeting notes are kept inside Notesnook. I also store secrets like SSH Keys, API Keys and the like (not passwords though) in the Notesnook Vault. Writing blogs inside Notesnook is also really fun because I can use the WYSIWYG editor and later directly export to Markdown or HTML.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Notesnook Image 3" class="wp-image-14993" height="640" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/notesnook-image-3-1024x640.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>How do you recommend someone get started?</strong></p>



<p>I think the best way to use Notesnook is to just start using it. It really is that simple. You don’t even need to create an account. Just go to <a href="https://app.notesnook.com">app.notesnook.com</a> or install Notesnook from your device’s app store to get a feel for it. There is also <a href="https://help.notesnook.com/">detailed documentation</a> about different features with step-by-step guides on how to use them. If you are coming from another note taking app, we also provide a dedicated and officially supported <a href="https://importer.notesnook.com">Importer tool</a> to help you easily migrate.</p>



<p>One thing new users find a little strange is how Notesnook is “note centric” instead of “organization centric”. In other words, you can just take your notes and worry about organizing them later as opposed to forcing you to create notebooks etc. This is intentional because more often than not organizing can get in the way of actually taking notes.</p>



<p>But yeah, there really isn’t much of a learning curve to Notesnook. The UI is functional and designed primarily to get work done instead of wooing/distracting users. I believe the most useful tool is the one that doesn’t get in your way.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for Notesnook?</strong></p>



<p>Notesnook still has a long way to go. We are currently working on v3 which will resolve a lot of the pain points reported by our users: tabs for multitasking, internal note linking (aka backlinking), table of contents, nested notebooks (aka folders), sidebar customization, more reliable note syncing, and better search. Aside from that, we provide a <a href="https://notesnook.com/roadmap/">detailed roadmap</a> to give our users some future perspective.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Abdullah! Where can people learn more about Notesnook?</strong></p>



<p>Thank you! You can learn more about Notesnook by visiting our <a href="https://notesnook.com/">website</a>, <a href="https://blog.notesnook.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://go.notesnook.com/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://go.notesnook.com/discord">Discord</a>, or <a href="https://go.notesnook.com/reddit">Reddit</a>.</p>

<title>Timeshielding: How to Do the Things you Actually Want to Do</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/timeshielding-time-management?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=timeshielding-time-management</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/timeshielding-time-management?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=timeshielding-time-management</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A topic that comes back often in conversations is time management. How do I write this newsletter every week, while managing a business, writing a book, and completing a PhD? Do I still have time to hang out with my friends and family? Can I share any tips around time management?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking control of your schedule</h2>



<p>Except if we end up inventing time travel, we need to accept the fact that there are only 24 hours in a day. In order to achieve our goals, we need to be smart about how we allocate our time to different tasks and activities.</p>



<p>What is urgent is often different from what is truly important. Short-term and long-term goals do not always align. What’s expected from you and what you actually want to do are not always the same. So how do you manage your time so you can achieve what matters to you while attending to your responsibilities?</p>



<p>I follow three simple principles:</p>



<p><strong>1. Make time for the things that matter, and not the other way around.</strong> I always take a few minutes at the beginning of the week to ensure I have time for the few key goals I’m working towards. At the moment, these are writing my book, completing my PhD, and taking care of my health. So I block time for these things, I make sure to move them if there are any overlapping meetings that were added by clients, and I feel good about knowing that I’ll have time for the things that matter.</p>



<p><strong>2. Become comfortable saying “no” or “let’s do this in a few weeks.”</strong> If something is neither important, nor urgent, nor authentically aligned with what currently feels most alive, I either say no or I ask if it’s alright to chat about it in a few weeks when I might have more headspace for potentially interesting yet low-priority projects. Now, here’s the magic behind why this works: more often than not, people don’t follow up, and that’s an hour I save for things I want to work on.</p>



<p><strong>3. Manage your energy, not your time.</strong> This means that instead of trying to fill your calendar with tasks to feel productive, try to keep your calendar as free as possible to allow a fluider approach to work. Move things around based on your energy levels. If you feel a spur of energy, you can decide to use the next hour to make progress on a creative project. If you feel low energy, you can reply to some unimportant emails. This is only possible if there’s enough wiggle room in your calendar.</p>



<p>Those principles are at the core of how I deal with our very real <a href="https://nesslabs.com/cognitive-bottlenecks">cognitive bottlenecks</a> that put hard limits on how much we can achieve. And there is one tool that has been instrumental in my ability to apply these principles. I call it timeshielding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to use timeshielding to protect your time</h2>



<p>Timeboxing is a common way to manage your calendar. Because it’s structured around fixed blocks of time and specific tasks, timeboxing can feel self-coercive, and many of us end up blocking time in our calendar then happily proceed to ignore these blocks.</p>



<p>I use a different approach that’s more fluid and flexible. Timeshielding is about protecting blocks of time in your calendar for what matters to you, with no specific task list. This could be for research, reading, creative brainstorming, or even just doing nothing. Because timeshielding feels more fun than timeboxing, you’re less likely to ignore the blocks in your calendar.</p>



<p>You can use timeshielding to achieve the following:</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Timeshielding helps you protect your creativity, attention, breaks, chronotype, and rest." class="wp-image-14985" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timeshielding-ness-labs-illustration-1024x576.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Protect your creativity.</strong> Make room in your calendar for your <a href="https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-attractors-the-diffuse-obsessions-that-shape-our-lives">curiosity attractors</a>, the rabbit holes and the mind wandering that can lead to unexpected creative breakthroughs. Let go of outcome-based goals for a few hours every week and focus on your creative output, with no performance metric or specific result in mind, other than feeling inspired and sharing your ideas with the world.</p>



<p><strong>Protect your attention.</strong> Avoid multitasking. Constantly switching between tasks has a terrible <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindful-context-switching">effect</a> on attention. <a href="https://nesslabs.com/single-tasking">Pick one area of focus</a> and give it your full attention for the duration of the session. Remove distractions by putting your phone in another room and turning off notifications on your laptop.</p>



<p><strong>Protect your breaks.</strong> It’s easy to fill your calendar with lots of things to do, without taking the time to let your brain recharge. Spend some time alone, go take a walk, meditate—whatever rocks your boat, as long as it involves getting away from your laptop and your phone. And consider putting <a href="https://nesslabs.com/structured-distraction-breaks-at-work">these breaks</a> in your calendar!</p>



<p><strong>Protect your body clock.</strong> Think about the times of the day where you feel more productive. Are you more of an early bird or a night owl? If you have enough flexibility to do so, schedule your time according to your <a href="https://nesslabs.com/chronotypes">chronotype</a>, with the most important tasks happening when you’re at your highest performance levels.</p>



<p><strong>Protect your rest.</strong> We tend to sacrifice rest in order to get more done. Well, that just doesn’t work. Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.99.2.525-535">shows</a> that being sleep deprived negatively affects your performance. It’s harder to focus and harder to switch between tasks when you’re tired. So set a time to close your laptop in the evening, and stick to it so you can wind down and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/sleep-better">get enough sleep</a>.</p>



<p>Timeshielding can be combined with other techniques to mindfully improve your productivity, such as using the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/moscow-method">MoSCoW method</a> to define your priorities or the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/decide-what-to-work-on-next">DECIDE framework</a> to choose what to work on next, but I found that tools don’t matter if you don’t get the fundamentals right.</p>



<p>Making space for creativity, avoiding multitasking, taking breaks, aligning your work with your chronotype, and getting enough sleep—these are the most important aspects of time management if you want to achieve your long-term goals without sacrificing your mental health.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="Why We Remember – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-14955" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-february-2024-1-683x1024.png" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>Neuroscientist and psychologist Charan Ranganath embarks on an exploration of memory’s profound impact on our lives, challenging the traditional view of it as merely a tool for recalling the past. Through engaging anecdotes and rigorous science, Ranganath illustrates memory’s crucial role in learning, decision-making, and even in our emotional healing processes. The book breaks down complex scientific concepts into understandable insights, combined with practical tips on improving memory. It also discusses how our understanding of memory can help with issues like memory loss and personal development. Through examples from science and Ranganath’s own experiences, the book makes a compelling case for the importance of memory in our lives. It will be a useful read for anyone interested in learning more about how memory works and how to make it better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Imagination: A Very Short Introduction</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img alt="Imagination: A Very Short Introduction – Ness Labs Book of the Month" class="wp-image-14956" height="1024" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ness-labs-book-of-the-month-february-2024-2-683x1024.png" style="width: 150px;" width="683" /></figure></div>


<p>Another great Oxford’s “Very Short Introduction”, this book dives into the essence of imagination as a key cognitive ability and a crucial aspect of human development. The book unpacks how imagination is involved in various aspects of human thought and how it profoundly influences our existence. Through a blend of philosophical, evolutionary, and literary insights, the author demonstrates imagination’s dual nature: it can distort reality, yet it also enriches our understanding and experience of the world. The discussion then explores its role in rational thinking, artistic creativity, scientific innovation, and everyday problem-solving. By drawing from a wide array of examples, from ancient cave paintings to modern technology and art, Jennifer Gosetti-Ferencei shows how imagination fuels not only the arts but also scientific and technological innovation. Her book offers a comprehensive overview of the theories of imagination across history and its indispensable role in human cognition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Balanced Brain</h2>

<p>Charles Duhigg’s latest book focuses on the art of conversation, presenting it as a skill that can significantly enhance our interactions both professionally and personally. Drawing on a wealth of stories and studies, Duhigg reveals that effective communication is about understanding the underlying layers of every conversation: practical, emotional, and social. He illustrates this through engaging examples, from a jury room’s consensus to the challenges faced by a CIA officer and a surgeon. The book provides clear guidance on recognizing and adapting to these conversation layers, highlighting how our experiences, values, and emotions influence our communication. Duhigg’s accessible writing and practical advice aim to teach readers to listen actively and express themselves more clearly. <em>Supercommunicators</em> offers great, practical insights into turning communication into a superpower, and will be a useful read for anyone looking to improve their ability to connect with others and be better understood.</p>

<p>In her latest book, Jennie Allen offers a fresh perspective on managing emotions in a way that fosters both spiritual and personal growth. Disputing the harmful advice to suppress feelings, Allen advocates for acknowledging and exploring our emotions as a pathway to self-discovery. Drawing from scientific research and her personal experiences, she introduces a practical five-step process to understand and act on our feelings constructively. Allen challenges the misconception that emotions are inherently bad, showing instead how emotional awareness can enhance our connection with ourselves, others, and the world at large. By embracing our feelings, even the painful and confusing ones, she explains that we can expand our capacity for emotional health.</p>

<title>The Alchemy of Generative Questions</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/generative-questions?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=generative-questions</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/generative-questions?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=generative-questions</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We all know that children are curious. Very curious. In fact, children ask more than a hundred questions an hour. This is how they explore, learn, and make sense of the world.</p>



<p>However, researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596240/">lament</a> that “over the course of their education, students and adults ask fewer questions and more passively accept facts as <em>the way things are</em>.” This is a shame, because asking questions is a crucial skill that fuels lifelong learning and critical thinking.</p>



<p>In your personal life, asking questions fosters deeper understanding and empathy which can support healthy relationships. Professionally, it drives innovation, encourages collaborative problem-solving, and leads to more informed decision-making. By not asking enough questions, we limit our potential for growth, understanding, and connection in an ever-evolving world.</p>



<p>There is a type of question that yield powerful insights and allows curious minds to better connect with others and explore the world. Those are called generative questions, a kind of questions that bring together various ideas or skills from different areas of knowledge and experience.</p>



<p>Generative questions do not only ask about facts, but also about feelings, underlying motivations, and cultural context. They are open-ended, multidimensional, and empathetic. They aim to <em>truly</em> understand the world.</p>



<p>While asking generative questions comes more naturally to some people, it can be learned by anyone. And when you ask generative questions, you get insightful answers. That’s a skill worth investing in.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Ness Labs Illustration: Generative Questions Lead to Insightful Answers" class="wp-image-14974" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/generative-questions-banner-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The transformative power of generative questions</h2>



<p>Without realizing it, lots of your work relies on thoughtfully crafting good questions: getting a helpful piece of information from a colleague, looking up the right thing, or probing a potential customer during a negotiation.</p>



<p>Ancient philosophical traditions also teach us to ask questions with intention. Socrates is famous for his use of questioning to investigate many topics, including the validity of an assumption, the logic behind an argument, and even the nature of the unknown.</p>



<p>The Buddha emphasized the importance of questioning to his disciples, and contemporary Buddhist practices continue to uphold this value.</p>



<p>Beyond satisfying your curiosity, crafting better questions allows you to do your best work.<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Huang%20et%20al%202017_6945bc5e-3b3e-4c0a-addd-254c9e603c60.pdf"> </a>Pr. Jim Euchner <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08956308.2022.2000205">explains</a> that it allows your to discover:</p>



<ul>
<li>Things that you believe that you know and which in fact you do know.</li>



<li>Things you believe that you don’t know but which, in fact, you do know (if you consider them properly).</li>



<li>Things that you believe that you know but in fact you do not know.</li>



<li>Things that you believe that you don’t know and which you, in fact, do not know.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, asking generative questions is a bit like being an alchemist. They have a transformative power that allows you to turn any conversation into a source of actionable information and creative insights.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to ask generative questions</h2>



<p>There is obviously no perfect recipe and a lot of your approach should depend on the complex dynamic interaction you have with the person sitting — physically or virtually — in front of you. That’s part of the “generative” aspect: thoughtfully crafting your questions based on the context and interaction.</p>



<p>However, there are a few general tips that can be applied to most conversations. Here are five guidelines to keep or to start asking generative questions.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Know your purpose.</strong> It’s easy to get distracted during a conversation. Try to make sure that every question you ask helps you gather either facts or your interlocutor’s opinion. Avoid empty questions to fill the time. Genuinely try to know more about them, and frame your questions accordingly.</li>



<li><strong>Start by listening.</strong> In the classic<a href="https://amzn.to/2zTwNPO"> </a><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>, Dale Carnegie advised to “be a good listener” and to “ask questions the other person will enjoy answering.” More than eighty years later, his advice still holds true. You can’t ask generative questions if you don’t listen to what the person has to say.</li>



<li><strong>Interrupt wisely.</strong> It’s not about never interrupting the person you’re chatting with. It’s about ending fewer sentences with a period, and more with a question mark. Don’t worry about asking the wrong question. Not asking enough is more detrimental to building a relationship than asking one poorly phrased question. That being said&#8230;</li>



<li><strong>Use the right wording.</strong> Avoid leading questions and use a neutral tone instead. Refrain hinting at your opinion or the answer you&#8217;d like to get. If you want honest opinions or accurate information, don’t prime your interlocutor with loaded questions. Keep them open ended so they have the option of giving you an answer you didn&#8217;t expect. (closed questions are often used in manipulative surveys to get the results needed to support a specific agenda)</li>



<li><strong>Build a hierarchy.</strong> Follow general questions with specific ones, focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time, and use something in the answer you got to frame your next question. This will help the conversation flow more naturally.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most important guideline to remember is simply to ask <em>more</em> questions. Of course, the tone, the framing, and the sequence of your questions will have a huge impact on the value you and your interlocutor will get from the conversation, but asking more questions is the best way to practice and ultimately get these right.</p>



<p>By asking generative questions, your conversations will be more productive, but also more enjoyable. You will be able to generate better ideas and, ultimately, to <a href="https://nesslabs.com/science-of-curiosity">cultivate your curiosity</a>.</p>

<title>Free-Floating Anxiety: When You Feel Anxious for No Apparent Reason</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/free-floating-anxiety?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=free-floating-anxiety</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/free-floating-anxiety?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=free-floating-anxiety</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Racing pulse, tense muscles, dry mouth, restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating… The symptoms of anxiety are many, but sometimes we can’t pinpoint why exactly we experience this panicky feeling. Objectively, everything seems to be going well, and yet the sensations of anxiety are definitely there.</p>



<p>The American Psychological Association <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/free-floating-anxiety">refers</a> to this phenomenon as <span style="background-color: #FFFACD;">free-floating anxiety</span>, a diffuse sense of uneasiness and apprehension not directed toward any specific situation or object. Although free-floating anxiety is not recognized as a disorder, it can still be very uncomfortable.</p>



            
            
                                        
            
            


<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"></div>



<h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-0db4c881 gb-headline-text">The origins of free-floating anxiety</h2>



<p>Free-floating anxiety is <a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07096.x">believed</a> to originate from a hyperactive amygdala, the part of the brain that participates in regulating emotional responses and particularly the fear response.</p>



<p>There are many reasons why the amygdala may become hyperactive, such as trauma. When someone goes through a traumatic experience, the wiring of the amygdala changes. This makes us more likely to stay in a state of high alert, always on the lookout for potential dangers — even when there are none.</p>



<p>Another potential cause for free-floating anxiety is chronic stress. If you are currently experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety symptoms may pop up during what feels like the most random of times because you are unconsciously bracing yourself for more stress.</p>



<p>Even though you believe you are just sitting in front of your computer, trying to study or doing work that feels fairly routine, your brain is playing a game of “what if” in the background, trying to figure out what could go wrong.</p>



<p>So of course, it’s can be hard to focus and to get any work done.</p>



<p>You may be thinking: I’ll just push through, surely the anxiety will eventually disappear. But unfortunately, it doesn’t work this way. Pushing through is yet another stressor. By trying to ignore your anxiety, you can end up feeling even more anxious. So, what can you do instead?</p>



<h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-fcb8a1a0 gb-headline-text">How to manage free-floating anxiety</h2>



<p>There are three simple techniques you can apply to manage free-floating anxiety. I call it the <span style="background-color: #FFFACD;">Full Spectrum Reset</span> because it addresses all the factors of anxiety in order of importance, starting with emotional factors, then cognitive factors, and finally behavioral factors.</p>



<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-959595bc gb-headline-text">1. Reset your body</h3>



<p>Anxiety is a psychophysiological response. It’s your body’s way of signaling that something feels off. One of the simplest ways to deal with free-floating anxiety is to stimulate your body’s parasympathetic nervous system, which will effectively counteract the fight-or-flight response by slowing down your heart rate, reducing your blood pressure, and helping your mind relax.</p>



<p>To do this, stop whatever you’re doing, and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/stretching-routine">stretch</a>. It doesn’t need to be a full-on stretching session. You don’t even need to get up if you can’t. You just need a few dynamic movements and maintaining your muscles in a position to the end of their range of motion.</p>



<p>Take a deep breath, inhaling while lengthening your spine, then exhale while rotating your torso to one side, gazing over your shoulder. Repeat the spinal twist on the other side. Inhale while lengthening your body, exhale while rotating your body. Taking slow, deep breaths will help stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system.</p>



<p>To finish resetting your body, drink a glass of water. Dehydration can mimic some symptoms of anxiety, such as having a dry mouth or feeling lightheaded, so staying hydrated can help manage those false triggers of anxiety.</p>



<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-ca41b30e gb-headline-text">2. Reset your mind</h3>



<p>Free-floating anxiety can arise from unconscious emotions. By naming your emotions, you will be able to better understand and manage them. This process helps in making your feelings more tangible and less overwhelming. This technique is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1754073917742706">called</a> affective labeling, where by naming your emotional state you can better manage your physiological response.</p>



<p>Research has found that engaging in affective labeling <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01916.x">reduces</a> activity in the amygdala and results in higher brain activity in your prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain in charge of executive functioning. Just labeling your emotions will help you feel more calm and in control, and reduce the sensation of free-floating anxiety.</p>



<p>The easiest way to do this is five minutes of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary">journaling</a>. Just ask yourself: What am I feeling right now? You don’t even need to write full sentences, just a list of words that describe your emotions. For example, you could write that you’re feeling:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tense</li>



<li>Worried</li>



<li>Nervous</li>



<li>Uneasy</li>



<li>Concerned</li>
</ul>



<p>Affective labeling is literally “putting feelings into words,” It only takes a few minutes, and it’s a free, non-chemical way to increase activity in your prefrontal cortex and reduce activity in your amygdala.</p>



<p>Instead of just feeling a general sense of anxiety, you may realize that what you are actually feeling stress about a deadline, or maybe you’re worried about an upcoming social event. Once you have labeled these emotions, you can start addressing them more effectively.</p>



<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-3fc28efc gb-headline-text">3. Reset your plan</h3>



<p>Free-floating anxiety can make us perceive tasks as more overwhelming than they actually are, which can make us feel stuck. Psychologically, this is a mix of “catastrophizing,” which is when we imagine the worst possible outcomes, and “analysis paralysis,” where overthinking things leads to inaction.</p>



<p>To reduce the cognitive load, you need to choose an action that requires minimal mental energy and no extra planning. Look at your task list, and choose the easiest thing you can do right now — not the most urgent one, not the most important one, but really the easiest task that you can do right now.</p>



<p>Is there an email you can send? A draft you can read to check for typos? Some little piece of copy you can write for social media?&nbsp;What you are looking for is a small win, something that will shift your focus to the present moment and move you from a state of paralysis to a state of action.</p>



<p>There you have it, the Full Spectrum Reset: reset your body, reset your mind, reset your plan. It’s a quick and easy way to deal with those moments when you are feeling anxious for no obvious reason:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reset your body.</strong>&nbsp;Stretch, breathe, and drink a glass of water.</li>



<li><strong>Reset your mind.</strong>&nbsp;Journal for five minutes to label your emotions.</li>



<li><strong>Reset your plan.</strong>&nbsp;Start one easy task to get unstuck.</li>
</ul>



<p>Again, those three steps should not take more than ten minutes. Anything longer may cause even more anxiety. Pressing “reset” needs to be easy and quick. The goal is to get rid of a random feeling of anxiety so you can get back on track.</p>

<title>Focus on the email that matters with Dmitri Leonov, founder of SaneBox</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/sanebox-featured-tool?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=sanebox-featured-tool</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<a class="featured-tool-label" href="https://nesslabs.com/featured-tools">FEATURED TOOL</a>



<p>Welcome to this edition of our tools for thought series, where we interview founders on a mission to help us think better and work smarter. Dmitri Leonov is the founder of <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/">SaneBox</a>, an email management service that connects to your inbox, identifies important messages, and hides distractions.</p>



<p>In this interview, we talked about email overwhelm, how AI can help us take back control of our inbox, the benefits of combining email management and time management, the myth of inbox zero, how to rediscover lost connections in your inbox, and much more. Enjoy the read!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Sanebox - Image 1" class="wp-image-14918" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sanebox-image-1-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>Hi Dmitri, thanks for agreeing to this interview! Why do you think we need to change our relationship to email?</strong></p>



<p>People spend a huge portion of their time and energy managing email. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRsUZK6Q2mc">According to Google</a>, the average person checks their email 11 times per hour, processes 122 messages a day, and spends more than a quarter (28%) of their work week managing their inbox – and managers spend a whopping 50% of their time on emails that they either don’t need to answer or that shouldn’t have been sent to them to begin with!</p>



<p>Now, there’s no denying that email has become an integral part of everyone’s workflow. But the time and energy needed to effectively manage reading, responding to, organizing, and deleting emails can feel completely overwhelming, leading to increased stress and anxiety – which can ultimately have a negative impact on both productivity and job satisfaction.</p>



<p>We need to change this unhealthy relationship to email. While email is a necessity, email overwhelm is not. There is a better way to manage emails – and to do so in a way that doesn’t make people feel stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed.</p>



<p><strong>And that’s what inspired you to create SaneBox.</strong></p>



<p>It is. Back in 2010, I, along with a small team, were looking for our next project. We did some research on email overload and it was clear that tackling that issue was the best way we could provide real value to our future clients. So, when we started SaneBox, we created a set of principles for what the ultimate product would need to deliver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those rules were that the customer doesn&#8217;t have to do or learn anything, it has to work everywhere people check their email today, to be as secure as humanly possible, to get better over time, and to be valuable enough for people to be happy to pay for. Those principles were the guiding force in SaneBox’s development.</p>



<p><strong>Those are solid principles. Now, how does Sanebox actually work?</strong></p>



<p>SaneBox leverages proprietary AI to filter and organize emails, automatically placing unwanted, unnecessary, or unimportant emails into separate folders – so when you open your inbox, all you see are the most important, urgent emails that need your immediate attention.</p>



<p>In addition to the platform’s standard platforms, SaneBox also allows you to create custom folders for your own preferred email categories – and then automatically filters them into those folders so they’re there when you need them.</p>



<p>SaneBox helps you organize your inbox – but it comes equipped with features that also make it easier to manage your inbox, like a “do not disturb” option that allows you to temporarily disable email notifications so you can carve out time for focused work and automatic reminders that let you know when it’s time to follow up on an email.</p>



<p>Basically, SaneBox allows you to receive and send emails when you want, how you want, and where you want – all without having to lift a finger.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Sanebox - Image 2" class="wp-image-14919" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sanebox-image-3-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p><strong>This sounds great. But what if we receive too many emails in the first place?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2023-2027-Executive-Summary.pdf">Recent data</a> projects that 361.6 billion emails will be sent in 2024 – so I think it’s safe to say that most of us are dealing with too many emails.</p>



<p>SaneBox is equipped with a variety of features that allow you to minimize the number of emails that hit your inbox; manage distracting, unnecessary, and unimportant messages; and get rid of unwanted or annoying emails, companies, and senders for good – like:</p>



<p>Many emails that come in are emails you want to read – just not immediately. <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/146-sanelater-what-to-do-with-my-sanelater">SaneLater</a> stores those emails so you can get to them on your own timeline – and will also send you a daily summary of what you missed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/235-saneblackhole-what-do-i-do-with-my-saneblackhole-folder">SaneBlackHole</a> allows you to get rid of unwanted emails in one click – and once you make that click, you’ll never receive another message from that sender again, which is perfect for banishing people or companies you’re not interested in from your inbox.</p>



<p>Leaders and managers are often CC’d on messages that are more FYI than actionable. And many of those messages they don’t actually need to respond to, which can clog up their inbox and keep them from seeing their most important or urgent emails. <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/203-what-is-sanecc">SaneCC</a> allows you to filter out emails you’re CC’d on so they don’t hit your inbox – but you can still access them if and when you want to give them a read.</p>



<p><strong>It sounds like you’ve combined email management and time management.</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. SaneBox isn’t just about organizing your inbox; it’s about optimizing your relationship with email and saving you time and energy so you can focus on more important things. On average, SaneBox saves users 2.5 hours each week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Sanebox - Image 3" class="wp-image-14920" height="575" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sanebox-image-2-1024x575.png" width="1024" /></figure></div>


<p>SaneBox offers a number of features that can help you save time on inbox management. First, as mentioned, <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/340-sanedonotdisturb-what-do-i-do-with-that-folder">SaneDoNotDisturb</a> allows you to put your inbox in “Do Not Disturb” mode so you can focus on work without any distractions.</p>



<p>Some emails are important and actionable – just not immediately. With <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/160-snooze-folders-create-custom-snooze-folders-to-hold-defer-mail-for-a-specialized-length-of-time">SaneSnooze,</a> you can defer emails to a future time, either by using preset folders (like SaneTomorrow or SaneNextWeek) or by creating custom folders that will deliver the emails back into your inbox on your chosen date and time.</p>



<p>Finally, keeping track of sent emails can be time-consuming. <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/139-reminders-overview-what-are-sanereminders-and-how-do-they-work">SaneReminders</a> will let you know if an email you’ve sent hasn’t been responded to in a certain time frame – and will give you a nudge to remind you to follow up.</p>



<p>Basically, SaneBox takes away a huge amount of the mental energy needed to effectively manage your inbox – so you can put that mental energy towards the things that matter most.</p>



<p><strong>What about sorting through existing email?</strong></p>



<p>With SaneBox’s AI, you can also train the platform to better sort your emails. Each day, SaneBox sends a Daily Digest of recent SaneLater emails; from there, you can train the AI on different ways to sort future messages.</p>



<p>For example, if there’s an email that you’d prefer to land in your inbox, you can train SaneBox to send it there (either once or indefinitely) – while if an email you have no interest in seeing ends up in your Digest, you can train the AI to automatically send future emails to SaneBlackHole.</p>



<p>You can also create custom folders for emails you get frequently – like SaneBills, SaneReceipts, or SaneFamily – and train the AI to automatically send related emails to those folders in the future.</p>



<p>The Daily Digest also lets you delete and/or archive emails from specific senders – which again, will train the AI on how to deal with future emails from said sender.</p>



<p><strong>Another aspect that makes SaneBox different is that it doesn’t require you to switch to a new email client.</strong></p>



<p>That’s right. SaneBox works with any email service that provides IMAP, EWS &#8211; OWA, or Active Sync, such as Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, AOL, iCloud, MS Exchange, Microsoft 365, Fastmail, Amazon WorkMail, and many others.</p>



<p>You can also use SaneBox anywhere you check your email, whether that’s a PC or Mac, desktop, tablet, or mobile.</p>



<p><strong>SaneBox can also help you rediscover lost connections. Can you tell us more?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/help/111-what-is-saneconnect-and-how-does-it-work?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=internal">SaneConnect</a> allows people to rediscover lost connections at other companies – as well as see if any of their colleagues have connections there as well. This tool can empower anyone to be a salesperson by delivering warm leads and reminding them of connections already made (put potentially lost) – which is a much more effective strategy than cold outreach.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of people use SaneBox?</strong></p>



<p>SaneBox is a fit for anyone who sends and receives email and is looking for a way to help them better manage, organize, and prioritize their messages, including managers, founders, executives, small business owners, entrepreneurs, individual contributors… Really everyone who deals with email overwhelm (and these days, who doesn’t?) can benefit from SaneBox’s features.</p>



<p><strong>What about you, how do you use SaneBox?</strong></p>



<p>In addition to all of SaneBox’s features, one strategy I use to more efficiently manage my inbox is calendar blocking. My first email blog is in the morning; I scan my inbox at the start of the day and identify the most important, urgent stuff – and then I deal with that first. My goal is to get the top priorities out of the way first thing. That way, I can clear it from my mind and to-do list and not waste energy thinking about it.</p>



<p>My other email block happens at the end of the day. During that time, I clear out messages I don’t need to get closer to Inbox Zero. I also use SaneSnooze to remove emails that don’t need my immediate attention so they’ll pop back in my inbox when I need to manage them.</p>



<p>I rarely get to Inbox Zero. But with SaneBox and my approach to email, Inbox 15 is a pretty regular occurrence.</p>



<p><strong>And finally… What’s next for SaneBox?</strong></p>



<p>Our company mission is to “think outside the inbox.” And we plan to continue doing that – including with an upcoming iOs app and a new features release later this year.</p>

<title>The Curiosity Matrix: 9 Habits of Curious Minds</title>
<link>https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-matrix?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=curiosity-matrix</link>
<guid>https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-matrix?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=curiosity-matrix</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All healthy human babies and young children display curiosity, suggesting this is an innate human trait. Exploring our environment and babbling questions appear almost universal in early childhood across cultures.</p>



<p>As an adaptive trait, curiosity draws us to seek information and new experiences. It’s how we learn about ourselves, others, and the world.</p>



<p>However, research shows our degree and focus of curiosity can even vary a lot. Curiosity differs <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635443/">between</a> people, it evolves within one same person over the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-19451-001">course of their lifespan</a>, and it can even fluctuate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067659/">throughout the day</a>.</p>



<p>Some people tend to be more systematically curious than others. Those curious minds are generally adventurous, creative, less risk-averse, and seem to seek and enjoy exploration more than others.</p>



<p>They’re a diverse group of people, but the literature suggests that they share some common habits that support their personal and professional growth.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img alt="Curiosity Matrix: 9 Habits of Curious Minds" class="wp-image-14906" height="576" src="https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/curiosity-matrix-curious-minds-ness-labs-framework-1024x576.png" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>The Curiosity Matrix</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>1. Seeking liminal spaces.</strong> Curious minds are not only comfortable in the in-betweens, they actively seek out those transitional moments of personal growth. Rather than racing through the uncomfortable phase of not-knowing, they enjoy <a href="https://nesslabs.com/liminal-creativity">exploring the gap</a> between what they know and what they don’t know. They can fall in love with problems and revel in what poet Mary Oliver calls “the pleasure of mystery.”</p>



<p><strong>2. Forming connections between ideas.</strong> Instead of thinking about the world in a linear way, curious minds <a href="https://nesslabs.com/thinking-in-maps">think in maps</a>. They practice <a href="https://nesslabs.com/networked-thinking">networked thinking</a> and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/combinational-creativity">combinational creativity</a>, and find delight when discovering an unexpected connection between two ideas. Their <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden">mind is a garden</a> and the world a giant playground where ideas can seed their imagination.</p>



<p><strong>3. Asking generative questions.</strong> For curious minds, every interaction is an opportunity to learn. Exchanging <a href="https://nesslabs.com/generative-questions">generative questions</a> is one of their favorite modes of communication. They not only ask about facts, but also about feelings, underlying motivations, and cultural context. Their questions are open-ended, multidimensional, and empathetic. Some of them even keep a list of their <a href="https://nesslabs.com/favorite-problems">favorite questions</a>.</p>



<p><strong>4. Exploring new interests.</strong> Because the world is full of potential <a href="https://nesslabs.com/curiosity-attractors">curiosity attractors</a>, curious minds have many interests which may not always overlap. However, it can be hard to channel their curiosity, and the fleeting urge to explore something new just for the sake of novelty can sometimes lead to distraction.</p>



<p><strong>5. Learning in public.</strong> Although it can be scary, curious minds make it a point to admit when they don’t know. Instead of trying to be the expert in the room, they consider themselves <a href="https://nesslabs.com/lifelong-learning">lifelong learners</a>. They are willing to be wrong. And they generously <a href="https://nesslabs.com/learning-in-public">share what they learned</a> with fellow curious minds.</p>



<p><strong>6. Challenging the default.</strong> Anything that seems obvious on the surface can become a topic of investigation for curious minds. They wonder about the reality of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/default-definitions">default definitions</a> and test their assumptions through <a href="https://nesslabs.com/personal-experiments">experimentation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>7. Listening with compassion.</strong> Because they want to deeply understand the world and others around them, curious minds tend to be empathetic. They try to listen without judgment and to embody the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/74750/the-heart-of-the-buddhas-teaching-by-thich-nhat-hanh/9780767903691">words</a> of Thích Nhất Hạnh: “If we cannot listen mindfully, we cannot practice right speech. No matter what we say, it will not be mindful, because we’ll be speaking only our own ideas and not in response to the other person.”</p>



<p><strong>8. Approaching difficult experiences with self-compassion.</strong> Any thought or emotion can be the seed of self-discovery for curious minds. Even without knowing the scientific terms for these habits, they practice <a href="https://nesslabs.com/metacognition">metacognition</a> to interrogate the thoughts that arise in their mind and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/interoception">interoception</a> to understand the sensations that arise in their body. They do not try to suppress these signals, but treat them as a helpful source of information.</p>



<p><strong>9. Welcoming the unpredictable.</strong> For curious minds, the fact that the world keeps on changing is a feature, not a bug. They believe that their response determines how much disruptions affect them, and they choose to respond with curiosity. They <a href="https://nesslabs.com/chaos-surfing">surf with chaos</a> to not only survive, but to thrive in chaotic times.</p>



<p>Curiosity has many <a href="https://nesslabs.com/science-of-curiosity">benefits</a> – it keeps you young, it helps you learn, and it foster better relationships. Injecting a little bit of curiosity into your life goes a long way.</p>



<p>The good news is, anyone can (re)learn to be more systematically curious in all areas of their lives. Although some studies <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322307003277">indicate</a> that curiosity may have a genetic component (DRD4-7R has been dubbed the “wanderlust gene”), most researchers <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-018-0015-7">agree</a> that curiosity can be nurtured.</p>



<p>A first step is to go through the nine habits in the Curiosity Matrix and ask yourself: how habitual are these practices in my daily life? What is one habit I can start building today to nurture my curiosity?</p>
